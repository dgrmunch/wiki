> “In SuperCooperators, mathematical biologist Martin Nowak and New Scientist editor Roger Higheld present for nonspecialists recent progress in understanding how cooperation evolves from the competitive interactions inherent in Darwinian dynamics. They argue that we now know enough about the mathematics of adaptation to conceive of cooperation as a fundamental evolutionary principle and not merely as a surprising feature of biology in some way at odds with evolutionary processes. [...] In the penultimate chapter, Nowak suggests unification in the form of one parameter, his sigma—the structure coeficient. Sigma measures the rate of like interactions in an evolutionary game (e.g., cooperators encountering cooperators or defectors encountering defectors). When sigma exceeds unity, cooperation invades; when below, selfishness. Sigma captures in one scalar value essential features of assortative interactions, and hence it points toward the essential processes underlying the origin of cooperation.”

> “The application of concepts like complex adaptive systems, arising from quantitative fields like biology and information theory, to the study of international relations is overdue. The assertion of realist theory that anarchy prevails in the absence of an international sovereign is much too simple: many forms of order, both natural and social, evolve in decentralized systems lacking any form of hierarchical authority. Axelrod’s book gives a number of examples of this, from international business and military alliances to the emergence of new actors over time. What is much less clear is whether the complex adaptive systems approach can offer much in the way of a positive theory of international relations. Such models tend to work best in situations with large numbers of relatively simple agents, as with biological populations. International politics consists of a small number of very complex agents whose behavior tends to be more chaotic.”
