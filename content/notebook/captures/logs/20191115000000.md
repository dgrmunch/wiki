Yesterday we came back to North Carolina after two years living in Spain. Greensboro, the city which was twice our home, is welcoming us back for the third time. Walking around. Breathing under a rainbow of autumn leaves. Friends and relatives. Smells. Sounds. Hugs. Everything seems like it was when we left. Continuity. Sense of permanence. I literally feel that time did not pass by. Our life is still here. A life which ended with tears in our eyes. A life which disappeared when we took that plane with a set of promises and a suitcase full of memories. A goodbye which lead to a cultural reverse shock and several months of re-adaptation to the Spanish culture. Rhizome. Lack of temporality. Loop. Here we are. Breathing. Alive.
