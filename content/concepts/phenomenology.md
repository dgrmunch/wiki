## Introduction

The term *phenomenology* describes a philosophical approach focused on the study of subjective/direct experience. 

Based in the initial work of Edmund Husserl, critical in the philosophical development of Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Francisco Varela or Jean Paul Sartre, phenomenology attempts to explore first-person experience through first-person research. 

Phenomenology could be considered a radical observation of raw phenomena, a far-beyond-empirical immersion in the immediate environment as it-is-given within the perceptual field of the subject, without theoretical frameworks, preconceptions and prejudices about phenomena. 

What is experienced in our minds could be sometimes a consequence of sensorial stimuli but, even in those cases, phenomenology does not care about the *objective world out there* but rather about the *experienced world as it is presented* in the subject's awareness. What is actually external (or transcendent, in the *husserlian* sense of the term) to the cognitive system is also phenomenologically immanent.  

> The correspondence (by Dupuy) between phenomenology and dynamic systems theory [...]  should be understood as follows. External events are [...] certainly not contained within the system, nor are they a mere product of what goes inside the system. Nevertheless, they are intentionally immanent, in the following sense: they do not arrive already labeled, as it were, as external events; instead they are constituted or disclosed as such, and with the significance they have, by virtue of the network's autonomous (self-organizing) dynamics. In other words, their status as external events for the system (as opposed to their status for an observer of the system) is a function of the system's own activity. Their meaning or significance corresponds to an attractor of the system's dynamics (a recurrent pattern of activity toward which the system tends), which itself is an emergent product of that very dynamics. The external world is constituted as such for the system by virtue of the system's self-organizing activity. Dupuy's proposal, in a nutshell, is that constitutional intentionality corresponds to a kind of self-organization. This proposal [...] is one of the key guiding intuitions of the enactive approach and neurophenomenology. **Reference:** <cite>Thompson, E., & Press, B. (2007). Mind in Life.

Phenomenology does not question the existence of an objective material world, and therefore it should not be confused with idealism, solipsism and [non-materialist pseudoscience](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Non-materialist_neuroscience). Actually, contemporary neurophenomenology works within the domains of natural sciences, specifically cognitive neuroscience.

However, phenomenology temporally "brackets" the natural attitude (our default epistemological assumptions) to explore phenomena as it unfolds in our conciousness. In that sense, phenomenology is not necessarily constrained to the analysis of experience as directly related to an external physical reality, but is rather extensible to other perceptual realms not necessarily correlated with any material world, like virtual reality, hypnagogia or other mental states such as dreaming. 

Therefore, its domain is *the experienced phenomena* in general terms.

### The phenomenological reduction


> There is an experience in which it is possible for us to come to the world with no knowledge or preconceptions in hand; it is the experience of astonishment. The “knowing” we have in this experience stands in stark contrast to the “knowing” we have in our everyday lives, where we come to the world with theory and “knowledge” in hand, our minds already made up before we ever engage the world. However, in the experience of astonishment, our everyday “knowing,” when compared to the “knowing” that we experience in astonishment, is shown up as a pale epistemological imposter and is reduced to mere opinion by comparison. [...] 

> The phenomenological reduction is at once a description and prescription of a technique that allows one to voluntarily sustain the awakening force of astonishment so that conceptual cognition can be carried throughout intentional analysis, thus bringing the “knowing” of astonishment into our everyday experience. [...]

> "The phenomenological reduction is properly understood as a regimen designed to transform a philosopher into a phenomenologist by virtue of the attainment of a certain perspective on the world phenomenon. The path to the attainment of this perspective is a species of meditation, requiring rigorous, persistent effort and is no mere mental exercise. [See source](https://www.iep.utm.edu/phen-red/) 


### Merleau-Ponty on perception and behavior

**Section reference:** <cite>Thompson, E., & Press, B. (2007). Mind in Life. Harvard University Press.</cite> 

> Human perception is primarily directed toward how intentions are expressed in other human beings rather than toward objects of nature and their sensory qualities. Human perception grasps intentions as "experienced realities," not as objects in a detached or intellectual sense. [...]

> As Merleau-Ponty points, anticipating subsequent research in developmental psychology, the infant's first experienced realities in visual perception are the face and gestures of the mother or caregiver. The mother's face is not an object or a mere collection of sensory qualities, but a center of intentional expression and action. Perception is thus first and foremost physiognomic, and later it is directed toward things as use-objects. Perception never loses its physiognomic quality; it remains physiognomic not simply in its nascent phases, but in its mature phenomenal character. [...]

> By "work," Merleau-Ponty means activities (ensembles of intentional actions) that transform physical and living nature and thereby modify the milieu or produce a new one (1963, p. 162). Work is forward-looking and creative or productive. By altering the present milieu, work in effect negates it in favor of a new one. (Merleau-Ponty uses the word "work” instead of "action" precisely to convey this Hegelian idea.) The correlative form of perception required for work is perception that presents its object not as something simply there now (something present and actual), but as something of use that can change other things (something oriented in relation to the future and possibilities).

> Whereas living structures are ontologically emergent with respect to physical ones, the human structure "perceived situation-work" is emergent with respect to living structures. It represents a new kind of relation between organism and milieu, or self and world.

> [...]In Merleau-Ponty's words: "use-objects and cultural objects would not be what they are if the activity which brings about their appearance did not also have as its meaning to reject them and to surpass them". This self-surpassing mentality is a structural precondition for cultural forms in the first place (even while it is always already reciprocally constituted by them in any of its concrete instances). Exemplified in the human order, this mentality is emergent not simply in relation to the living order overall, but also in relation to higher animals.

> With these ideas, Merleau-Ponty passes from a static and genetic phenomenology of form or structure to a generative phenomenology
of intersubjectivity and culture (or from a phenomenal topology of structure to a phenomenal topology of culture.




### Edmund Husserl's noetical horizon

**Section reference:** <cite>Thompson, E., & Press, B. (2007). Mind in Life. Harvard University Press. </cite>

> A horizon is not a thing "out there” but rather a structure of appearance. It therefore implicates or points back to the perceiver for whom appearances are so structured. In phenomenological language, “horizon” taken noematically as a structure of appearance
necessarily implicates “horizon” taken noetically as a structure of consciousness. One could say that a horizon is the precondition for the appearance of anything, except that “precondition" is too static. Stated in a genetic register, a horizon is a dynamic structure of disclosure in which both the object (noema) and consciousness (noesis) partake.
