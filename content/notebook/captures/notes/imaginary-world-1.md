> Imaginary worlds are cognitive gates towards our true phenomenological potential. They let us explore the nature of subjective ontologies in a virtual universe that do not have any correspondence with our objective reality. They truly become actual worlds in the experience of the thinker, the observer, the reader, the creator. 

> These narrative experiments constitute the starting point of a variety of unfolding ontologies, of distinct and parallel universes full of creative and philosophical possibilities.

> My synthetic multiverse is mainly text-based but it is inevitably interwoven with visual artwork, music, coding, and constructed language explorations.
