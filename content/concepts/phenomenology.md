## Introduction

The term *phenomenology* describes a philosophical approach focused on the study of subjective/direct experience. 

Based in the initial work of Edmund Husserl, critical in the philosophical development of Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty or Jean Paul Sartre, phenomenology attempts to explore the contents of consciousness through first-person research. 

Phenomenology could be considered a radical observation of raw phenomena, an empirical immersion in the world as it is captured by the senses, without theoretical frameworks, preconceptions and prejudices about reality.


## Quotes


> There is an experience in which it is possible for us to come to the world with no knowledge or preconceptions in hand; it is the experience of astonishment. The “knowing” we have in this experience stands in stark contrast to the “knowing” we have in our everyday lives, where we come to the world with theory and “knowledge” in hand, our minds already made up before we ever engage the world. However, in the experience of astonishment, our everyday “knowing,” when compared to the “knowing” that we experience in astonishment, is shown up as a pale epistemological imposter and is reduced to mere opinion by comparison. [...] 

> The phenomenological reduction is at once a description and prescription of a technique that allows one to voluntarily sustain the awakening force of astonishment so that conceptual cognition can be carried throughout intentional analysis, thus bringing the “knowing” of astonishment into our everyday experience. [...]

> "The phenomenological reduction is properly understood as a regimen designed to transform a philosopher into a phenomenologist by virtue of the attainment of a certain perspective on the world phenomenon. The path to the attainment of this perspective is a species of meditation, requiring rigorous, persistent effort and is no mere mental exercise. [See source](https://www.iep.utm.edu/phen-red/)
