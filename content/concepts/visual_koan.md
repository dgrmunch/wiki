## What is a koan?

In the *Rinzai* school of _zen_, a _koan_ is a question whose answer can not be found through logic thought, or a dialog that does not make sense form a rational standpoint. 

There is not an equivalent in any western philosophical theory, neither in the so-called continental philosophy nor between the analytical philosophy authors.

Living in a society which is strongly founded on the premise of logic positivism and under the generally accepted truth of *reason* as the most valid epistemological tool, it seems naive to re-coin an anti-logical term such as _koan_; or at least to consider that it can provide any useful hint in our quest for knowledge.

However, there is something appealing in the _koan_ that can be easily transposed to the realm of photography and visual arts. It can fit within the western conception of aesthetics, a conception in which we usually renounce to reason without any regret.

## Why is zen interesting from a western philosophical viewpoint?

* Secular buddhism provides philosophical foundations closer to skepticism, empiricism, atheism and critical thinking than to religious and dualistic approaches.
* Lack of doctrines, faith dogmas and magical thought. 
* Practice/praxis towards the destruction of the dualist notion of identity.
* Zen goes beyond Nietzsche's negation of God. Rather than being just an atheism, it negates both *theos* and *arthropos*. It's a radical deconstruction of dualism, including the subject-object dichotomy and the Cartesian notion of the self.
* Radical empiricism: 
  * avoiding the wandering mind while experiencing reality without filters.  
  * ignoring both future projections (imagination) and past memories (episodic information) in order to perceive the present reality as it is.
* Similar approach to **phenomenology** in the sense of considering sensual perception over rational thought by *bracketing* our *default mode* through meditation.


## The visual koan as an artistic philosophical tool

When observing a piece of visual arts we don’t necessarily focus on its deep meaning through logic and reasoning. We do exactly the opposite. We usually tend to appreciate the artwork with an aesthetic eye and take the most of it based on our intuition, simply guided by out-of-the-blue suggestions and pure visual pleasure.

If there is a hidden message in a piece of artwork, the way to find it is seldom rational. Rather, usually an open sensitivity and an intuitive and extremely subjective approach are required to really appreciate art.

Visual arts (and generally speaking, any artistic creation) can be therefore considered a valid cognitive gate to stop logical reasoning and activate in our brains a different kind of experience. An experience that enables judgments-free thought and an open-ended subjective exploration.

There is no need for an objective truth in visual arts, and therefore [consensus](consensus.md) is rarely useful in that specific context.

**Visual koans** are, in that sense, pictures displayed without any obvious message, images which can be used as entry gates to an entirely [subjective ontology](subjective_ontology.md).

In the description of [phenomenology](phenomenology.md) as a concept can be read:

> La fotografía puede servir como una herramienta para bloquear el torrente de pensamientos y abstraernos en el fenómeno instantáneo.

We can assume *photography* as the *einklammerung* (*bracketing* or "judgment suspension") mentioned by Husserl, a trigger to stop our natural state and switch to a different mode of perception and understanding of the world around us: the phenomenological *epoché*.

My photos are open doors to my own personal reflection, but they can be used as dark windows to look through in order to explore your own narratives.

Their real meaning, their real message, is encoded in the rhizome. There are so many ways to understand it but I recommend an open mindset. Replace your previous epistemologies and embrace a [rhizomatic epistemology](rhizomatic_epistemology.md).
