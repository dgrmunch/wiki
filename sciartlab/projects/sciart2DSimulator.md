# SciArt 2D Simulator

## Description

The SciArt 2D Simulator is a 2D Graphics Engine developed by Diego Gonzalez-Rodriguez to be used as an extensible tool for our research in agent-based modeling, artificial life and educational games.

Our simulator is developed in Groovy, Java and Processing and it provides basic tools to model multi-agent systems, social behavior and emergent properties in digital environments. It will also serve as a support to our study of Self-Organized Linguistic Systems (SOLS) and will provide an easy way to develop from simple Turtle-like systems for educational purposes to complex P2P Social Dynamics.
