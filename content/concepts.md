## Introduction

> Towards a philosophy of the rhizome

The following concepts do not pretend to replace any standardized or generally accepted definition. 
Contrarily, the concepts included in this wiki could serve as an entry map to navigate a subjective ontology. In that regard, they are just my own philoshophical reflections and, therefore, they don't require any social [consensus](concepts/consensus.md).

In this philosophical attempt, pictures and texts are interconnected; both are clues for the interpretation and understanding of each other. Both are nodes in this semantic network, both are structural elements in the sense-making process, both are entry gates to navigate the complexity and simplicity of the [rhizome](concepts/rhizome.md).

According to the previous statement, remember to spend some minutes observing the pictures displayed under the [photographic projects](../content/projects/photography.md) section to really understand the concepts. Sometimes images provide valid cognitive hints (see [visual koans](concepts/visual_koan.md)) not easily found through language.
