## Description

When two or more parties need to come to an agreement, share a unique accepted truth or enforce a common policy, **consensus mechanisms** seem the most democratic way to avoid misconceptions, mitigate conflicts and unify a shared view about any given topic.

Consensus is usually the best way to build alternatives to centralized policies and hierarchical power structures, while providing [distributed](distributed_networks.md) awareness and a flat responsibility layer. In that sense, consensus would be fair enough in the context of any given community to replace top-down models such as the ones of representative democracy by bottom-up social dynamics.

However, the whole idea of deliberative democracy, in which assemblies replace centralized structures, is obviously inefficient. 

Social experiments in the last couple of decades have become hard to sustain when the number of participants went beyond some threshold. *Decay* -the decrease in the levels of compromise- and, in some cases, the gradual centralization of supposedly bottom-up processes in homogeneous groups of people are a clear problem of assemblies.

In order to become sustainable in the long term, different mechanisms can be introduced in consensus layers. 
For example, cryptography and incentives.

Large scale coordination and [distributed](distributed_networks.md) consensus between nodes can be easily sustained thanks to the use of peer-to-peer technologies such as the blockchain.

Specifically, the Bitcoin network has enabled more than a decade of large-scale coordination by combining cryptographic hashes, Merkle trees, P2P networking and a Proof-of-work algorithm. 

Surprisingly, the Bitcoin network has enabled the common agreement of a significant volume of worldwide population during so many years. And without any central control, just by using a common protocol, a unique consensus layer empowered by P2P technology.

The combination of blockchain technologies with reputation systems, liquid-democracy models and smart contracts thanks to the arrival of Ethereum and other technologies have enabled a fascinating playground to create large-scale consensus. 

Digital signatures and simple cryptography with append-only log structures can be used too for one-to-one agreements without the need of large-scale layers such as blockchains.

Consensus is important to guarantee a shared understanding and a common ontology. It implies assumptions not necessarily valid for everything though. For example, in scenarios in which subjective ontologies, pluralism and heterogeneity are demanded, there is no need for common vocabularies, common policies or any shared social contracts.  Individual [identity](identity.md) would have its own narrative.

In those cases a simple blog, a wiki and a digital signature are more than enough to enable the existence of a certain notion of truth, certain individual opinion, certain ontology.
