# Writing about Identity?

tags: identity, notes, identity-notes


 > Identity is an ontological problem which sometimes may be better addressed *allowing the reader to infer*, scaping from the accuracy of academic writing (facts-based jail) and plain sociological data. I actually found that artistic expressions such as [visual koans](visual_koan.md) and poetry can be the best ways for ”stepping outside the academic discipline into a more subjective experience".
 > A combination of different communication styles can be interesting, specially if mixed with visual arts like photography as complementary philosophical tools. Because different levels of analysis require different toolboxes.
