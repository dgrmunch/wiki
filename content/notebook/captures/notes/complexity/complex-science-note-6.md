About Artificial Societies (simulated multi-agent systems):

> Axelrod and other researchers accordingly reformulated the game to allow simulated agents to play a series of games with one another, treating their strategies and their memory of the behavior of other players as variables (Axelrod 1997). Because the success of particular strategies is frequency-dependent, the entire game can be treated as a dynamical system evolving over time, with global characteristics that emerge from the local interactions of players and strategies. Under these circumstances, Axelrod found that cooperation would emerge under a wide range of conditions.

About mammals with memories of cooperation:

> Similarly, evolutionary biologists have suggested that cooperation (reciprocal altruism) occurs only among social species that are capable of recognizing other individuals and remembering whether they cooperated on previous occasions. Examples include vampire bats, dolphins, elephants, primates and most especially humans (summarized in Sigmund 1993). Humans turn out to be remarkably good at predicting whether others will cooperate.

Another model of evolution of cooperation:

> Mathematician Karl Sigmund has developed simulations of games in which players remember encounters they have observed; here cooperation develops very quickly (Sigmund 1993, Nowak & Sigmund 1998). Such simulation results have inspired behavioral ecologists to reexamine biological systems.

And the biggest step, jumping to “social contract”:

> But cooperation is by no means the only emergent property investigated by social simulations. Philosopher Brian Skyrms has studied the evolution of the social contract by modeling it as a problem in the evolution of dynamical systems. His most ambitious models tackle such large questions as the evolution of justice, linguistic meaning, and logical inference. Skyrms finds that “the typical case is one in which there is not a unique preordained result, but rather a profusion of possible equilibrium outcomes. The theory predicts what anthropologists have always known?that many alternative styles of social life are possible”.
