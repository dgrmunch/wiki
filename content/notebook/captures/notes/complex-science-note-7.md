> In the 1960s Kauffman posed a simple question: Is Darwinian natural selection, alone, responsible for the patterns of order we see in the living world? Nonliving phenomena like snowflakes exhibit spontaneous order through a process of self-organization. Might self-organizing processes also play a role in biology?
To explore this question, Kauffman used computer simulations as a surrogate for Gould’s “divine tape player”. Although Kauffman’s research was originally aimed at understanding evolution at the level of genes, his results suggest that “the range of spontaneous order is enormously greater than we had supposed” (Kauffman 1995).

About the notion of “attractor”. In my research, I use most of the times the expression “equilibrium state”:

> In the language of dynamical systems, the state cycle is called an attractor and the array of initial states that flow into it a basin of attraction. The more initial states that flow into a given attractor, the larger its basin of attraction.

About cooperation and the “tragedy of the commons”. Pointing out that game theory could be a good approach to study evolution of cooperation in biological and social systems:

> “Like many anthropologists, as a graduate student I had little interest in game theory because it seemed to embody implausible assumptions about human nature, what Marshall Sahlins calls the common average social science wisdom. But the complexity approach has led to a major shift in perspective, from static models of rational choice to the evolution of strategies over time, and from local interactions to their global effects. Perhaps the most active area of research in this field is concerned with the broad subject of social cooperation, which spans topics ranging from the evolution of cooperation in social animals to the human management of natural resources.”
