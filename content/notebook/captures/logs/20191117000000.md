In 2019 I came back to the U.S. with more nostalgia and familiarity than in my previous stays. The fascination of the newbie, and the over-saturation of my previous digital experiments, was replaced by pure black and white film photography. This time, rather than shooting with my Canon DSLR, I used a 1976 Pentax k1000 to capture my thoughts in film, as a reflection about the lack of temporality in conjunction with the materiality of inhabited spaces. Old film to capture the permanence of Greensboro, our home long time ago.
