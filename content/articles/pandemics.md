## Information spreading in distributed networks

For more than a decade, I have been defending [distributed networks](../concepts/distributed_networks.md) as the best topology for resilience and dynamic adaptation to changes. 

In my thesis, during my PhD, I was actually studying the impact of **decentralization** in information spreading (horizontal propagation) and how, under certain conditions and in combination with functional **heterogeneity**, collective knowledge production was favored by a distributed organization of societies. 

I actually coined the term *P2P Societies* to highlight that resilient and innovative communities will thrive thanks to an improvement in **peer-to-peer dynamics** and a gradual reduction of friction in person-to-person exchanges thanks to digital tools in combination with new political and social experiments. A theoretical and formal justification for *bottom-up* emergent properties in dynamic systems, in opposition to *top-down* policies in centralized and hierarchical structures.

Obviously, this was conceived and analyzed from an *Information Sciences* perspective, taking into account the impact of the Internet, but also the success of *commons-based peer production*, an increasing decentralization of digital media and the arrival of the distributed web (*blockchain-based technologies*, *IPFS*, and so on).

However, in the context of the current *COV-19 pandemics* (which is happening while writing this text in March 2020), I have started to see the serious disadvantages and the negative impact of fast and horizontal information spreading. 

Both biological and digital information can be understood under a common analytical framework: **complex adaptive systems**. And obviously, a virus propagates its genetic information from host to host in a *peer-to-peer* fashion. 

Pandemics can be perfectly described as *P2P* phenomena, not only as an analogy or a metaphor, but rather as a reality that actually fits the criteria. 

Pandemics and *peer-to-peer* social dynamics are strongly related, as far as a virus, in addition to its molecular structure, is just a horizontally propagated piece of information which replicates, mutates and spreads from node to node (in this case from human to human).

COV-19 or the flu can be studied under a similar analytical viewpoint. Distributed networks increase their propagation. Heterogeneity increases adaptation and resistance. Mutation favors the survival of the virus and the deprecation of possible vaccines. 

The same math can be applied in all those cases. Network theory can be assumed as a valid model to predict person-to-person infection. 

And the same advantages that I could see during my first years in grad school, when I studied **conjugation** as a *peer-to-peer* (P2P) communication mechanism between bacteria, used by bacterial populations to share their DNA plasmids and therefore exchange mutations as potential innovations, can be found in viruses maximizing their possibilities for survival in dynamic environments.

At the end, viruses are not living systems, but they are encoded pieces of genetic information, ready to be transferred in between systems with actual cellular machinery. And they just need that external cellular machinery to keep them "alive" and guarantee an exponential number of copies. They need the network, a network without friction, without centralized policies and without static boundaries. Therefore, they love distributed networks.

And that is the interesting part. The enemy of *P2P dynamics* is the centralization of power; centralization of media, centralization of decision-making, centralization of the notion of truth, centralization of communication mechanisms. Politically speaking, the enemy of *P2P social dynamics* is the centralization of the *top-down* rules imposed by nation states against the free will of its citizens. 

Increasing centralization in the free flow of digital information can lead to censorship, manipulation, propaganda and lack of access to global information. But what about increasing centralization in the free flow of biological information? Can it be useful, at least temporarily, in the context of an outbreak? Yes. Executive policies to restrain people's free movements can mean a considerable decrease in the number of infections, avoid the death of thousands of people and even the destruction of global economy.

The question arises when we don't want to use enforcement and *top-down* policies, if we want to solve the problem from a *distributed strategy*.

Can pandemics be avoid without central control? It depends.


## Individualism vs collectivism

For years I have fought experimentally and theoretically against the historical enemies of mankind: centralization and hierarchies. 

I wanted to live in a world without hubs, without filters, without neither constraints nor boundaries, without nation states and executive rulers. And somehow I ended up studying both in biological and digital systems the benefits of decentralization, of distributed networks.

I always conceived decentralization as a catalyzer to speed up the evolution of human societies. I always thought that the antidote to centralized power was an pseudo-anarchist model based on digital technologies and self-organized social experiments, always guided by commons-oriented and generous-by-nature agents. 

However, in the realm of decentralization advocates there was always a quite dichotomized political spectrum: 

* **Individualism**: Right wing libertarians rooted their ideological foundations in the invisible hand of the market, in rational agents trying to maximize their individual interests following a selfish behavior. Paradoxically, they based their goals in a competitive accumulation of capital, a centralizing trend which would probably lead to more monopolies, injustice and inequality.

* **Collectivism**: Left wing anarchists were more attractive to me, more oriented to mutualism (in line with Proudhon or Kropotkin), rooted in nature-based examples of altruism in the animal realm. *P2P Social Dynamics* would not care that much about maximizing individual capital, but rather about helping the whole community to thrive or overcome an external threat or a harmful situation. 

> Community well being on the left versus individual success on the right. Huge difference.

I wanted to think that the second group was something else than a bunch of crazy dreamers, that human beings were generous, loved each other and wanted everybody else to have a happy and healthy life. 

An then, the coronavirus outbreak.

When the COV-19 virus arrived I initially thought that our nation states would not have to be as strict and executive as the Chinese government was when everything started in Wuhan. Somehow, we lived in democracies which valued freedom over everything else. 

I thought citizens would just follow experts' advices, that people would trust science and listen the recommendations of epidemiologists, freely respecting their guidance.

I thought people would just make the right decisions. Not coughing to others. Washing their hands. Keeping a security distance. Thinking in elderly and people with compromised immune systems. Not gathering in groups in public spaces. In other words, taking care of the whole network through simple local actions. 
 
The romantic dream of distributed networks; the naive assumption of selfless fraternal relationships between peers enabling successful societies without the need of a central government imposing restrictions.

> Wrong. 

The virus arrived and people did not follow any of the experts' recommendations. A mixture of denials and professional clowns making jokes about the virus soon became trendy in social media. Conspiracy theories infected society as a whole even before the COV-19 was in our blood. And we all were doomed.

> "This is just a simple flu. Nothing to worry about. We are not China. We are European democracies."

The importance of individual behavior, common sense and community-oriented responsibility was gone. And probably never was there. It was just an old dream of **collectivists**. 

**Individualism** won. People followed their own personal interests. They kept traveling for vacation, they went to terraces, lined up for hours to buy tobacco and drunk together in public squares when college was closed. They gathered with tens of kids in parks after public schools were closed to prevent more infections. And so on.

It was better for their individual and selfish interests. Oh! And at the same time they bought everything they could from the grocery stores. Maximizing selfishness and, of course, making use of their capital.

On the other side of the world, a communist regime seemed successful against the virus. National control, executive decisions, military discipline, hierarchy. Wow. A centralized network stopping the propagation of the virus. 

But was just the use of force? Was just the fear to disobey the government? Or also a sense of belonging, a sense of community, a sense of responsibility?

> *Again. Community well being on the left versus individual success on the right. Huge difference.*


## Centralization as a temporary solution?

*Distributed networks* and their supposed resilience and strength relied on the historical context in which they were invented (and actually proposed for the design of ARPANET by Paul Baran, as the blueprint for the Internet). 

Distributed networks were intended as the most resilient structures in the context of a nuclear war. At the time, a nuclear attack would have destroyed any centralized network just by targeting the central node, the main server, the hub. However, by making the network flat and decentralized, with all the nodes having the same importance, the network would be invincible. 

Invincible. Yes, at least for a nuclear attack. But what about a biological attack? What about a virus? And what about fake news? What about memes full of hate speech? 

Distributed networks are extremely vulnerable and can be easily flooded. 
And this is exactly what happened. On one hand, our globalized world, full of low cost flights and individual freedom, enabled an easy world-wide horizontal propagation for a virus which in the past would had been restrained to local or national boundaries.

On the other hand, fake news, relativistic jokes, denial arguments and ideological disinformation also spread through the global network.

People did not do anything.

In this context, the success supposedly could only rely in more centralized control and state-reinforced aligned action with martial discipline.

And even in my case, a defender of freedom and decentralization, I felt extremely relieved when the government sent all of us to our homes.

With my freedom completely limited during the quarantine, telecommuting, without being able to walk around -only going out to buy groceries or pharmaceutical products-, I still wondered if everything could just have been avoided with common sense, with coordinated effort towards the same direction, with a mutualist ideal and a sense of belonging to a bigger community, to a bigger species. 

Maybe centralization was an option we could have skipped. Maybe if *P2P Social Dynamics* would actually had existed and social agents would had focused on  win-win strategies, on the commons, on the mutual benefit, rather than in our individual self-interest.

With more **collectivism** and less **individualism**.
