Bilingual non-native life is a cognitive challenge. It pushes you to live a life with a reduced linguistic toolkit. Sometimes it seems *Tokipona-ish*. A limited English vocabulary/grammar. A lack of phrasal verbs. A broken pronunciation. A non-judgemental understanding of language as a flexible vehicle for communication and experimentation, not for an academic test.
