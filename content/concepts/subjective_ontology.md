## Description

A **subjective ontology** constitutes the set of mental entities of an individual mind. A subjective ontology causally emerges from its neurophysiological brain correlates, which could be studied by [cognitive neuroscience](../../tags/neuroscience.md). However, it represents the domain of what is real from an individual perspective and it is directly linked to its[*](../notebook/pronouns.md) personal [identity](identity.md). 

When combined with other subjective ontologies through communication, social dynamics and consensus mechanisms, it leads to **collective ontologies** and social configurations (and what we generally define as culture).

Both subjective ontologies and collective ontologies emerge from human [sense-making](sense-making.md) processes.
But far from any dualism, accepting the existence of a unique material reality and an objective truth (the physical world and its rules), we should assume that these ontologies constitute philosophical realities which could also be studied from a [phenomenological](phenomenology.md) perspective, as they are perceived and experienced by the subject.

In that sense, [neurophenomenology](../../tags/neurophenomenology.md) seems a valid tool to understand the human mind in a context of pluralism.

[Decentralization](decentralization.md) of communication infrastructures contributes to the preservation/increase of human diversity and functional heterogeneity, enabling the permeability of subjective ontologies through a [rhizomatic epistemology](rhizomatic_epistemology.md), replacing dogmatism with co-existence and common understanding.

Wikis like this one enable individuals to contribute to a common pool of global online resources. By publishing my subjective ontology in an interoperable and transnational language like English, I can share my understanding of reality with others and contribute to a diverse repository of knowledge in order to co-create collective ontologies with other peers.
