## Future improvements

* The [P2P School](p2p-schools-notes.md) framework could be eventually forked and extended to operate with off-grid nodes, in order to be fully functional in communities without internet connection.
  * Coordination and exchanges mechanism could be accomplished though a *P2P School Ambassadors* program, enabling interactions between communities in an off-the-grid way.


> **Deschooling**: is a term invented by Austrian philosopher **Ivan Illich**. Today, the word is mainly used by homeschoolers, especially unschoolers, to refer to the transition process that children and parents go through when they leave the school system in order to start homeschooling. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deschooling

> **Unschooling**: **John Holt** became disillusioned with the school system after several years of working within it; he became convinced that reform of the school system was not possible and began to advocate homeschooling. He believed that "children who were provided with a rich and stimulating learning environment would learn what they are ready to learn, when they are ready to learn it". Holt believed that children did not need to be coerced into learning; they would do so naturally if given the freedom to follow their own interests and a rich assortment of resources. This line of thought came to be called unschooling. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Holt_(educator)

> ** Collective Liberation & Anti-Oppression** through **Self-Directed Education (SDE)**: We believe in collective liberation, and that the path towards that is through being actively against oppression. Our rights, liberation, and freedom are intertwined with one another, and we cannot be free while another is oppressed. https://www.self-directed.org
