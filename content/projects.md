## Photography

Photography is my main artistic tool. 

Considering the growing amount of artistic projects I have been working on during the last years, I've created a [specific page](projects/photography.md) for a selection of them.

## Video

In the past I wanted to explore the potential of movie-making to share stories about causes I worried about. I have never been a professional film maker neither tried to be a good hobbyist either. 

I just wanted to do interviews and some visual ethnography during my time in places like Senegal, USA or Bolivia. 

The quality of the final products is not very good, considering that the resources that I had at that time were very limited. The most recent video was filmed with a DSLR and a tripod i borrowed from the University of North Carolina's library. For the other ones, older, I just used a small digital camera (before I even had a smartphone). No microphone, no tripod, no plan. 

Just a hand-held camera, a laptop for post-production, and some stories to tell. Amateur documentaries with message.


### [Looking for Identity](https://youtu.be/1rUHNIJ7rn0) (English)

> Visual ethnography with a film-making approach to explore multiculturalism and individual/social identity in the context of the U.S.A.

This movie was a project I develop some years ago while living in America. It talks about the American identity from a multicultural point of view. 

Some controversial issues are exposed, presenting a nation with a heterogeneous society, a complex and evolving multi-ethnic identity and a conflict of cultural forces and discourses.

In the moment of historic change in which this has been filmed (2016-2017), the U.S.A. faces a moment of transformation and tensions between a national identity and a large number of racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic identities, between assimilation and intercultural engagement.
