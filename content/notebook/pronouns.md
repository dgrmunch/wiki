## Preferred pronouns

* **It**: can be used to describe **epicenity** (lack of gender distinction).
  * It is my preferred pronoun to replace terms like *social agent*, *subject* or *individual*.
  * It represents **gender-neutrality** but can be also used to describe non-living subjects. Therefore, it can be useful when talking about artificial agents, *bots* and other entities within the context of my writings which are not necessarily human.

* **He/Him**: it is the pronoun I identify with according to my sexual orientation and both my sexual and gender identity. 

## Gender-neutral / gender-inclusive pronouns


> A gender neutral or gender inclusive pronoun is a pronoun which does not associate a gender with the individual who is being discussed.

> Some languages, such as English, do not have a gender neutral or third gender pronoun available, and this has been criticized, since in many instances, writers, speakers, etc. use “he/his” when referring to a generic individual in the third person. Also, the dichotomy of “he and she” in English does not leave room for other gender identities, which is a source of frustration to the transgender and gender queer communities.

> People who are limited by languages which do not include gender neutral pronouns have attempted to create them, in the interest of greater equality.

Even though I seldom require this pronouns when writing, it is important to know them in case somebody (a friend, a relative or somebody I am gonna write about) identifies with one of them.
