# GAVC: Generative Art and Visual Complexity

## Description

This project aims to explore the potential of algorithmic implementations to generate visual art.

We are exploring how narrow Artificial Intelligence and other computational paradigms can be considered valid tools to facilitate the emergence of aesthetic creations.

We combine traditional mathematical approaches such as recursivity, fractals or L-Systems with AI techniques such as neural networks, agent-based modeling or genetic algorithms.

One of our main interests is how generative art can be created by machines autonomously.  We prototype software applications which can produce art by themselves and can support artists in diverse creative tasks.
