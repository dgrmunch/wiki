This raga reminds me of a minor Pentatonic ascending and the Dorian scale descending.

2. Rag Bihag (ascending) C-E-F-G-B-C (descending) C-B-A-G-F#-E-D-C

This is similar to both the plain Major scale and the Lydian scale on the descent.

 3. Rag Kirvani (ascending) C-D-Eb-G-Ab-B-C (descending) C-B-Ab-G-F-Eb-D-C

This resembles the Harmonic minor scale.

 4. Rag Tilang (ascending) C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C (descending) C-Bb-A-G-F-E-D-C

This one is the Major scale going up and the Mixolydian scale coming down.

 5. Rag Pilu (ascending) C- Eb- F-G-B-C (descending) C-Bb-Ab-G-F-Eb-D-C

Similar to Melodic minor going up and Aeolian on the way down.
