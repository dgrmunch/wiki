 > The further I am from "my standard character" (exploring what it feels to be "another character") the more aware I am of the common elements, of my non-self. Identity is more clear on the road, on the plane, on the way. Oppositely, the closer I am to my "standard character" (i.a. the more redundant is the environment and the expected behavior) the cloudy is my sense of pure being.

To me the hardest issue is to realize that the community which accepted one character will reject the other, perceived as a threat. The community will kill the individual Identity to impose the standard, the norm, the accepted forms.
