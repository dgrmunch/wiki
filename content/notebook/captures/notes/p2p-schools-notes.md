**Attention!** **This is just a draft.**
 The final project will be eventually published in the SciArt Lab website. Feel free to contact me at xmunch (at) xmunch.com if you want to be part of the conversation. This is a work in progress and we are pretty much open to suggestions. 

## Scope

This project goes beyond the scope of STEAM education, one of the points in which the **SciArt Lab** has been usually focused. It is rather intended to define a common infrastructure for a heterogenous ecosystem of learning processes out of traditional school systems.

The idea of the *P2P Schools Framework* begun as a quest for possible answers to our personal problem as parents, which led us to look for a solution extendable to other people in the same situation.

By drafting a framework for a bottom-up learning system within the context of *unschoolers* and *worldschoolers*, we are embracing the ambitious attempt of modeling a network of families and collectives, an ecosystem of **P2P Schools** self-organized by the community of learners. This network can have different kinds of nodes:

  * **Family-managed P2P School:** a family or group of families in which both parent/s and kid/s are part of the maintenance of their own P2P School, sharing time, practices, materials, locations, knowledge, resources, and activities.
  
  * **Collective-managed P2P School:** an institution or collective (museum,  hacker space, charity, neighborhood association, activism collective, library...) can manage its own P2P School, providing experiences or resources to other participants in their communities and the network, co-creating a pool of value.

  [...]


* P2P Schools should operate in a sustainable way.
* Managing a P2P School should be low cost, and suitable for families living in big cities in which renting a space is not an option, and in which transforming small apartments in maker spaces for kids or exploratory spaces for toddlers not always seems feasible.

## The financial problem 

* Having one parent out of the job market to attend kids is one of the problems we would like to address. The project should explore solutions to guarantee an extra financial income.

* Incorporating an opt-in economic model for P2P Schools, in order to guarantee family income without compromising the co-creation of commons should be one of the main issues to address.


## Target


Our initial target are families and communities that have access to traditional schools but are considering something beyond a curricula-oriented schooling and homeschooling model:

* Families who are directly embracing **unschooling** as a way to allow their kids to learn in freedom and explore learning in a self-directed way, guided by their interests and not a pre-design curricula.

* Families who are traveling to different countries during years or months as expats, digital nomads, researchers or activists, and find in **worldschooling** an alternative approach for their kids education.

* Families who are forced to *school* their kids but want to offer them an opportunity to learn after-class in a different way through participatory workshops, DIY commons production, etc... but don't have access to maker spaces / hacker spaces / fablabs. 

* Communities which, due to geographical circumstances or social problems, don't have access to a school system (ie. refugee camps) but that can be connected to the network through a **Collective-managed P2P School**.

In both cases the **P2P Schools** framework should provide value to families' needs, both in the case of:

* Unschoolers: during the time span in which this practice is not illegal (ages vary depending on the country).

* Schoolers: as a complementary tool for self-directed after-class experiences when unschooling is not a possibility.


## What can we offer?

* A framework to operate locally while participating in a global ecosystem.
* A platform to make visible all those families and communities which are exploring new ways of learning.
* A channel for interoperability between different learning methods and approaches, as a mutual benefit for families. 

## The framework

* Logos / Badges / Media / Community identity 
  * Families which don't fit in the current system will find a shared identity by becoming P2P Schools. 
* Web Platform:
  * The project should provide the web infrastructure to register a P2P School in the network.
  * P2P Schools will have access to an onboarding process to be included in the network. The onboarding process will include introductory videos and materials to the concept, the values of the project and the common goal of contributing to a new model of education.
  * This platform should allow members to find other P2P Schools in their area and any world location. 
  * P2P Schools will have access to resources, coordination and communication mechanisms with other schools.
* Research outcomes:  
  * P2P Schools will be able to include reports and participate in the polls and research projects.
  * Our research outcomes will provide value to the community,and will server as a feedback to improve.

## Future improvements

* The framework could be eventually forked and extended to operate with off-grid nodes, in order to be fully functional in communities without internet connection.
* Coordination and exchanges mechanism could be accomplished though a *P2P School Ambassadors* program, enabling interactions between communities in an off-the-grid way.
