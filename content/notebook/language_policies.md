# Language Policies

tags: notebook, language

## Minority Language at home (ML@H) 

* We both are non-native speakers but we feel comfortable speaking in English. In that sense, there is not need to switch to One Parent One Language (OPOL), which would be useful if one of us was native and the other did not feel comfortable.
* Bilingualism fosters cultural heritage. Even though we are not from an English speaking country, we have spent a important part of our lives living abroad and have a wide community of international friends we would love our kid to interact with.
* We should focus on improving our skills, accent and lexicon every day.

## Secuential bilingualism

* This approach works well if it starts early enough. 
* For example, we are gradually increasing the amount of English language we provide to our kid, with a chronological sequence of gradual immersion taking place. 
* For example, if we only use English at home, he can reject this as a valid worldwide communication tool eventually. In that moment it is important to find an English playgroup, a bilingual school, travel to an English-speaking country.
* Traveling or going to English speaking coffee shops or Meetup events can be very useful.
* Introduce Youtube/TV to enforce language in the topics he is interested into. Using language across different domains is important for him to understand its potential.

## Family members

* If we talk to the kids all the time in English, family members will not understand them. This initially can cause rejection in grandparents and can cause a language policy crisis in parents.  
* In those cases we should remind grandparents the goal. They should be patient and, in the meantime, we should directly push them to encourage Spanish acquisition. We want a real bilingualism so their input in Spanish is more than welcome. 
* Grandparents can be empowered if they feel they have a very important role providing good quality Spanish to the kids.
* Same when other people from the environment have an opinion.
