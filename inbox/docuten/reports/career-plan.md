## Career Plan: Technical Lead / Lead Software Engineer

Decentralization and distributed technologies have been part of my personal and professional path since so many years ago. However, I truly feel that besides the hype, blockchains are only important when distributed consensus is needed. 

As part of my academic and professional career, Research and Development have been always present. I finished my Ph.D. while working in Enxendra. And actually, it was around my third or fourth year at Docuten, when my "blockchain expertise" started to be considered an asset to be used commercially. Before that, I was a Software Engineer with a growing variety of responsibilities. And the blockchain was part of my personal and side-career entrepreneurial experiments.

So far, I really feel that I have already provided enough value as Blockchain Expert to Docuten. Probably it is the right moment to get some return of the investment, rather than continuing developing solutions in that regard. No more technical effort is needed in the following months (in my humble opinion).

Our DLT infrastructure, our smart contracts and its integration with our product is quite mature and does not need 100% of my effort anymore. At the same time, my current role is still important for the Business, Commercial, and Marketing side of the game, at least regarding the marketing-lead efforts to promote our company as one of the "cool" leaders in the blockchain war :)

However, in relation to more technical aspects, I rather feel that I want to keep growing as a Software Engineer. I like to get work done and allocate efforts where they are actually needed.

Before my current role as Blockchain Expert, I already worked for several years in the realm of Software Development, performing tasks related to Functional Analysis, Design decisions, and full-stack programming.

As a Senior Software Engineer, I explored different technologies, learned about architecture, design patterns, testing, analysis, project management, team collaboration and a wide variety of topics within this field of knowledge.

In that regard, rather than directing my career towards a specific paradigm like blockchain-related technologies, I feel quite comfortable evolving in a wider spectrum.

In that regard, I would consider my goal-role something like what is called *Lead Developer* or *Lead Software Engineer*:

> They can act as a senior developer (mentoring, providing general design guidance and puting work into the foundation and early stages of a product's development) [...] But more importantly, they are a bridge or connector between the development team and the other business-oriented departments in the organization.

According to what I have been reading, a *Lead Software Engineer* should have the following skills:

 * Good communication skills
 * Good understanding of the product
 * Good understanding of the business problem the software is solving
 * Good understanding of the field the software's users are part of 
 * Understanding of other disciplines like management, product development, marketing, etc.

I honestly think that so far I have been already performing some of the responsibilities of this role for a while. Additionally, I consider that some of the skills which are required by that role are part of my current strengths.

I believe though that I still have so many things to learn as a Software Engineer. And considering that probably I should keep the "Blockchain Expert" label for commercial purposes during months (or years, you never know), I have enough time to work towards my professional improvement in that regard. 

The trick is to find which are the issues I should consider more important in order to continue growing, as a *Lead Software Engineer*, as a *Technical Lead*.
 

### Medium-term Goals (2020):

Focus: **High-Quality Product**

* Personal goals:
    * Improving TDD knowledge in order to apply it to Docuten.
    * Improving Clean Code + Good Practices
    * Internal talks / Mentoring

* Team-oriented goals (help walking towards...):
   
    * Decrease time span since the creation of an issue to its final deployment in a Production environment.

* Bonus track (if there is time and value is provided):
    * Product-oriented R&D
    * Keep posting articles (coordinate with Marketing)
