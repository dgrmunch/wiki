## Description

A subjective ontology constitutes the set of mental entities of an individual mind. A subjective ontology causally emerges from its neurophysiological brain correlates, which could be studied by [cognitive neuroscience](../../tags/neuroscience). However, it represents the domain of what is real from an individual perspective. 

When combined with others subjective ontologies through communication and consensus mechanisms, it leads to social dynamics and collective ontologies.

Both *subjective ontologies* and *collective ontologies* emerge from human [sense-making](sense-making.md) processes.
But far from any dualism, accepting the existence of a unique material reality and an objective truth (the physical world and its rules), we should assume that these ontologies constitute philosophical realities which could also be studied from a [phenomenological](phenomenology.md) perspective, as they are perceived and experienced by the subject.

In that sense, [neurophenomenology](../../tags/neurophenomenology.md) seems a valid tool to understand the human mind in a context of pluralism.
