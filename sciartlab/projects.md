## Future projects


* **Neuroscience for kids**: 

This project would allow us to perform our SciArt experiments of DIY Neuroscience using EEG low-cost technology in combination with our virtual reality technology and our STEAM educational events. We will be able to explore phenomenological aspects of visual perception, specially in VR, artistic production and photography. 

The possibility of getting an affordable neuroscience equipment would allow us to extract raw data from situated/embodied experiences, giving us the possibility of correlating neural event-related potentials and brain waves with sensory stimuli within the context of SciArt experiments.

The use of neuroscience to *naturalize* phenomenological descriptions within a more analytical framework with actual brain data would really give us a potential tool. 

Additionally, if the EEG device is wireless or easy to carry and we could perform *out-of-the-lab* experiments, capturing data about situations in which embodiment and immersion are crucial, providing a valuable tool to study situated cognition.

## Ongoing projects

* [Alda-tabs](https://dgrmunch.github.io/blog/blog/2017/alda-tabs.html): Domain Specific Language for Guitar Players in the Java Virtual Machine: A piece of software to help guitar players to “execute” their music notes in the JVM, compose songs and get audio feedback with basic tab syntax.

* [Artificial Intelligence Music Generation](https://dgrmunch.github.io/blog/blog/2017/digital-music-creation.html):  Set of cellular automata with emergent properties for music composition. Each cellular automaton is able to compose its own music based on simple rules, evolving while it plays synthetic instruments in Ableton Live or external devices through MIDI events.

* [SciArt Lab Metaverse components](https://dgrmunch.github.io/blog/blog/2017/building-a-distributed-metaverse.html): The potential of WebVR is amazing. It leads to new opportunities for developers and content creators, fixing the problem of interoperability between three-dimensional environments by bringing the community together around web standards (compatible with any virtual reality hardware and accessible from any web browser). We are creating open-source virtual reality components to be used in our SciArt projects.

* [Building a lab in Decentraland](https://dgrmunch.github.io/blog/blog/2017/building-a-distributed-metaverse.html): After some of the SciArt Lab Metaverse components were published in Github and Twitter, we were mentioned a couple of times in the Week of A-Frame series (supported by Mozilla). Some weeks later, we were contacted by the team of Decentraland offering support for our project. Decentraland is one of the most promising projects of the new blockchain-based startup ecosystem. They raised $24 million during their ICO. Forbes wrote an article about them recently, remarking how new economies may emerge very soon in virtual worlds. It combines the possibilities of open standards, WebVR and decentralized technologies within a conceptual and economic framework: shared ownership of the platform. Since then we started to build the *SciArt Lab Metaverse Branch* as a district in Decentraland. 

## Transition Projects

Legacy projects which are currently managed by other organization.

* [Bitmind](https://dgrmunch.github.io/blog/blog/2017/blockchain.html): Decentralized entrepreneurial initiative for the exploration of Open Value Networks (OVN/DAOs) by using blockchain-based technologies. Project transferred to the P2P Foundation.

## Legacy Projects


* [xmunch atomspace](https://github.com/dgrmunch/xmunch-atomspace/wiki): Visual tool for the dynamic construction of neural and semantic networks for knowledge representation, reasoning and learning in an abstract space of atoms.

* [SciArt 2D Simulator](projects/sciart2DSimulator.md): 2D Graphics Engine for agent-based modeling, artificial life and educational games.

* [GAVC](projects/gavc.md): Generative Art and Visual Complexity: This project aims to explore the potential of algorithmic implementations to generate visual art.

* [Soundbox](https://github.com/SciArtLab/soundbox): Experimental digital environment for synthetic music creation. Transform your voice or your instrument in a MIDI interface.


## Research topics

### Sound Synthesis and Computational Music Composition

Hacking music with both sound synthesis and algorithmic composition, combining experimental music with new technologies. Discovering how coding and music can be combined by prototyping domain-specific languages, enabling self-composed songs with genetic algorithms or re-discovering MIDI controllers to create audio art.

### Virtual Reality: Building a Lab in a Distributed Metaverse

During the last year we have been exploring how the SciArt Lab could contribute to the emergence of the distributed metaverse. We had the chance of testing new virtual reality open-source technologies and develop several WebVR components with a triple goal:

* Create our own immersive experiments in virtual reality for phenomenological and artistic explorations.
* Contribute to the upcoming 3D Web, sharing content and open-source components with the idea of a future distributed metaverse in mind (built on the top of a-frame + ipfs).
* Build the facilities of the SciArt Lab in a virtual space, in order to have a place always accessible, independently of our location in the physical world

###  Complex Systems and Artificial Life

Studying the emergence of complex behavior in self-organizing systems, such as artificial life simulations, biochemical experiments o social organisms.

###  Data Visualization, Digital Art and Visual Explorations

Some of our projects are focused in the development of data visualization tools. Others explore new ways of expression, visual ethnography and photographic/film representation through the use of physical methods, lighting and digital processing. Others are oriented to computer graphics, artificial systems simulation, educational games and generative art.

### Constructed Languages and Knowledge Representation

Exploring the intersection of artificial agent-based models with constructed languages and discovering news ways for knowledge representation, conscript development and visual languages design.
