*Abstract*

> Bacteria have demonstrated an amazing capacity to overcome environmental changes by collective adaptation through genetic exchanges. Using a distributed communication system and sharing individual strategies, bacteria propagate mutations as innovations that allow them to survive in different environments. In this paper we present an agent-based model which is inspired by bacterial conjugation of DNA plasmids. In our approach, agents with bounded rationality interact in a common environment guided by local rules, leading to Complex Adaptive Systems that are named ’artificial societies’. We have demonstrated that in a model based on free interactions among autonomous agents, optimal results emerge by incrementing heterogeneity levels and decentralizing communication structures, leading to a global adaptation of the system. This organic approach to model peer-to-peer dynamics in Complex Adaptive Systems is what we have named ‘bacterial-based algorithms’ because agents exchange strategic information in the same way that bacteria use conjugation and share genome.

> “In SuperCooperators, mathematical biologist Martin Nowak and New Scientist editor Roger Higheld present for nonspecialists recent progress in understanding how cooperation evolves from the competitive interactions inherent in Darwinian dynamics. They argue that we now know enough about the mathematics of adaptation to conceive of cooperation as a fundamental evolutionary principle and not merely as a surprising feature of biology in some way at odds with evolutionary processes. [...] In the penultimate chapter, Nowak suggests unification in the form of one parameter, his sigma—the structure coeficient. Sigma measures the rate of like interactions in an evolutionary game (e.g., cooperators encountering cooperators or defectors encountering defectors). When sigma exceeds unity, cooperation invades; when below, selfishness. Sigma captures in one scalar value essential features of assortative interactions, and hence it points toward the essential processes underlying the origin of cooperation.”

> “The application of concepts like complex adaptive systems, arising from quantitative fields like biology and information theory, to the study of international relations is overdue. The assertion of realist theory that anarchy prevails in the absence of an international sovereign is much too simple: many forms of order, both natural and social, evolve in decentralized systems lacking any form of hierarchical authority. Axelrod’s book gives a number of examples of this, from international business and military alliances to the emergence of new actors over time. What is much less clear is whether the complex adaptive systems approach can offer much in the way of a positive theory of international relations. Such models tend to work best in situations with large numbers of relatively simple agents, as with biological populations. International politics consists of a small number of very complex agents whose behavior tends to be more chaotic.”

> In the 1960s Kauffman posed a simple question: Is Darwinian natural selection, alone, responsible for the patterns of order we see in the living world? Nonliving phenomena like snowflakes exhibit spontaneous order through a process of self-organization. Might self-organizing processes also play a role in biology?
To explore this question, Kauffman used computer simulations as a surrogate for Gould’s “divine tape player”. Although Kauffman’s research was originally aimed at understanding evolution at the level of genes, his results suggest that “the range of spontaneous order is enormously greater than we had supposed” (Kauffman 1995).

About the notion of “attractor”. In my research, I use most of the times the expression “equilibrium state”:

> In the language of dynamical systems, the state cycle is called an attractor and the array of initial states that flow into it a basin of attraction. The more initial states that flow into a given attractor, the larger its basin of attraction.

About cooperation and the “tragedy of the commons”. Pointing out that game theory could be a good approach to study evolution of cooperation in biological and social systems:

> “Like many anthropologists, as a graduate student I had little interest in game theory because it seemed to embody implausible assumptions about human nature, what Marshall Sahlins calls the common average social science wisdom. But the complexity approach has led to a major shift in perspective, from static models of rational choice to the evolution of strategies over time, and from local interactions to their global effects. Perhaps the most active area of research in this field is concerned with the broad subject of social cooperation, which spans topics ranging from the evolution of cooperation in social animals to the human management of natural resources.”

About Artificial Societies (simulated multi-agent systems):

> Axelrod and other researchers accordingly reformulated the game to allow simulated agents to play a series of games with one another, treating their strategies and their memory of the behavior of other players as variables (Axelrod 1997). Because the success of particular strategies is frequency-dependent, the entire game can be treated as a dynamical system evolving over time, with global characteristics that emerge from the local interactions of players and strategies. Under these circumstances, Axelrod found that cooperation would emerge under a wide range of conditions.

About mammals with memories of cooperation:

> Similarly, evolutionary biologists have suggested that cooperation (reciprocal altruism) occurs only among social species that are capable of recognizing other individuals and remembering whether they cooperated on previous occasions. Examples include vampire bats, dolphins, elephants, primates and most especially humans (summarized in Sigmund 1993). Humans turn out to be remarkably good at predicting whether others will cooperate.

Another model of evolution of cooperation:

> Mathematician Karl Sigmund has developed simulations of games in which players remember encounters they have observed; here cooperation develops very quickly (Sigmund 1993, Nowak & Sigmund 1998). Such simulation results have inspired behavioral ecologists to reexamine biological systems.

And the biggest step, jumping to “social contract”:

> But cooperation is by no means the only emergent property investigated by social simulations. Philosopher Brian Skyrms has studied the evolution of the social contract by modeling it as a problem in the evolution of dynamical systems. His most ambitious models tackle such large questions as the evolution of justice, linguistic meaning, and logical inference. Skyrms finds that “the typical case is one in which there is not a unique preordained result, but rather a profusion of possible equilibrium outcomes. The theory predicts what anthropologists have always known?that many alternative styles of social life are possible”.

Ref: *Krakauer, D.C The Complexity of the Gene Concept . SFI Bulletin. (2009 ). Essay on the nature of the gene concept arising from a meeting with this title at SFI.*

> “DNA or RNA, transcribed and translated into a unique protein, with unambiguous expression and quantifiable selective value, has always been an ideal rather than a reality. Under most definitions the gene has been presumed to perform three functions: to serve as a unit of inheritance, a regulatory element in developmental dynamics, and an atomic unit of selection. In each case there is a mutable component, well behaved and easily identifiable, that survives cell division, can be turned on and off as a unit through suitable regulatory pathways, and contributes a quantum of fitness to an organism when expressed. The work—contribution to heritable, regulatory or selective variance—in each of these cases is presumed to be done by the gene, and so the gene occupies, understandably, a central position. [...] We might think about this modified gene concept in computational terms as some procedural element, or function, instantiated in sequences of code, contributing to one or more adaptive behaviors. The procedure or function describes the set of regulatory operations to be executed in some systematic fashion to generate a stable transcript. The code that furnishes the arguments for the function is the ordered collection of nucleotides stored in an enzyme-readable form distributed over the genome. And the final output of the procedure is the modification of phenotypic variability through contributions to cellular function. The gene is thereby a computational, or algorithmic element, exploiting underlying sequence structures, and is not merely a distributed structure itself.”
