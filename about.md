## Summary

To mention some of the labels which summarize my identity, I am a father, a partner, a multidisciplinary researcher, a software engineer, a social entrepreneur and a lifelong learner.

After some years living between America and Europe as a digital nomad, I consider myself a fully remote professional.

I am the founder of the **SciArt Lab**, a Research & Development organization for the open exploration of Science, Art, and Technology with a focus on commons-based peer production and hands-on learning. 

I have a wide background as a researcher. I’ve been Research Fellow at the **P2P Lab**, a spin-off of **Tallin University of Technology** and the **P2P Foundation**. I have collaborated with research groups such as the **Global Brain Institute of the Free University of Brussels**, the **Critical Making Lab at the University of Toronto** and the **University of North Carolina at Greensboro** in diverse topics such as Hands-on Learning, Critical Making, P2P dynamics, IT & Software Development, Philosophy of Information Science, Complex Adaptive Systems,Artificial Intelligence, or Social Implications of Technology. 

I have also worked and collaborated with different universities in Spain (*URJC, UC3M, UPM,...*) and I still continue with an open collaboration as a researcher with *eComplex: Economics and Complexity Group * at **University of Valencia**.

I was founder and coordinator of **Bitmind**, a commons-oriented startup to explore the potential of DAOs/OVNs and the evolution of social complexity in agent-based models and production communities. Bitmind had an international impact in the context of Applied Research & Open Source development around OVNs/DAOs. Since 2017 it will be a project of the P2P Foundation.

Additionally, I am a hobbyist photographer, a self-guided researcher/writer and a digital artist. I have other side projects and conduct some self-directed research initiatives.

For years I have been exploring the evolution of social complexity in agent-based models. I have also studied diverse topics such as decentralized technologies, neuroscience, genetic algorithms, systems biology, hands-on learning, self-organization and distributed knowledge production.

I enjoy self-guided research, applying qualitative approaches such as visual ethnography to study diversity of identity/identities in real social agents, open source coding to bootstrap the potential of mankind, DIY Neuroscience and a [phenomenology-based](content/concepts/phenomenology.md) approach to philosophy to dig into the nature of human experience. My current main research interests are phenomenology and alternative educational models powered P2P social dynamics.

## Pathways

In this section you can find some maps which can be helpful to understand in detail both my resume, my personal evolution and my academic/professional profile.

Every map highlights in dark gray the locations I have explored during specific pathways, both academic/professional and personal. Each map is followed by a brief text and link to a section in which I deeply describe the corresponding pathway.

For example, if you are interested in my academic and professional resume, below the *Academic Map* there is a link to a page with a detailed textual description of my [Academic Path](content/notebook/maps/academic.md).

You can also read about the importance and meaning of social agent's [pathways](content/concepts/pathways.md) in the [concepts](content/concepts.md) section.

### Academic Path

<div id="academicMap" style="position:relative; width: 100%; margin-bottom:10px;border: 1px solid black;"></div>

Read about my [Academic Path](content/notebook/maps/academic.md), a page which explains what I have learned through several years of study and research, an explanation which is contextualized in both a spatial and a temporal location.


### Personal Path

<div id="personalMapUSA" style="position:relative; width: 100%; margin-bottom:10px;border: 1px solid black;"></div>
<div id="personalMap" style="position:relative; width: 100%; margin-bottom:10px;border: 1px solid black;"></div>

This representation of my personal path is just a bi-dimensional visualization of several years of trips around the globe. Obviously, it only represents a bird-view projection of countries and states which I had the chance to explore. 

It does not go deep in specific coordinates. It ignores cities, national parks, small towns, trails, lakes, streets, coffee shops, planes, trains, forests or mountains. It does not track any experiences in the ocean. Neither events, nor people or weather conditions are mentioned. Temporal details are not captured anyway. 

However, it summarizes how traveling constituted a very important part of my individual exploration. How moving freely has been as basic to me as breathing.

Some time ago I wrote a post about how traveling helped me to [embrace the postmodern condition](http://blog.xmunch.com/blog/2017/la-llamada.html) and overcome my own prejudices but the radical importance of traveling in my philosophical quest is better addressed in this article about the [situated epoché](content/articles/situated.md).
