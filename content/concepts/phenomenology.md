## Introduction

The term *phenomenology* describes a philosophical approach focused on the study of subjective/direct experience. 

Based in the initial work of Edmund Husserl, critical in the philosophical development of Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Francisco Varela or Jean Paul Sartre, phenomenology attempts to explore first-person experience through first-person research. 

Phenomenology could be considered a radical observation of raw phenomena, a far-beyond-empirical immersion in the immediate environment as it-is-given within the perceptual field of the subject, without theoretical frameworks, preconceptions and prejudices about phenomena. 

What is experienced in our minds could be sometimes a consequence of sensorial stimuli but, even in those cases, phenomenology does not care about the *objective world out there* but rather about the *experienced world as it is presented* in the subject's awareness. That should not lead to any misconception about phenomenology, as far as it should not be confused with idealism and solipsism. 

Phenomenology does not question the existence of an objective material world. Actually, neurophenomenology works within the domains of natural sciences, specifically cognitive neuroscience. However, phenomenology is not necessarily constrained to the analysis of experience as directly related to an external physical reality, but is rather extensible to other perceptual realms not necessarily correlated with any material world, like virtual reality, hypnagogia or other mental states such as dreaming. 

Therefore, its domain is *the experienced phenomena* in general terms.


## Quotes


> There is an experience in which it is possible for us to come to the world with no knowledge or preconceptions in hand; it is the experience of astonishment. The “knowing” we have in this experience stands in stark contrast to the “knowing” we have in our everyday lives, where we come to the world with theory and “knowledge” in hand, our minds already made up before we ever engage the world. However, in the experience of astonishment, our everyday “knowing,” when compared to the “knowing” that we experience in astonishment, is shown up as a pale epistemological imposter and is reduced to mere opinion by comparison. [...] 

> The phenomenological reduction is at once a description and prescription of a technique that allows one to voluntarily sustain the awakening force of astonishment so that conceptual cognition can be carried throughout intentional analysis, thus bringing the “knowing” of astonishment into our everyday experience. [...]

> "The phenomenological reduction is properly understood as a regimen designed to transform a philosopher into a phenomenologist by virtue of the attainment of a certain perspective on the world phenomenon. The path to the attainment of this perspective is a species of meditation, requiring rigorous, persistent effort and is no mere mental exercise. [See source](https://www.iep.utm.edu/phen-red/)
