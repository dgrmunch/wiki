When thinking about the most extended theories of the mind, I clearly find more certain the notion defended by embodied cognition and dynamical systems. 

At the beginning of my career, when studying Strong AI, I found myself very attracted by both **computationalism** (oriented to *deductive reasoning* and symbol manipulation, and therefore closer to the domains of formal lingüistics and the thesis of functionalism) and **connectionism** (focused on pattern recognition and kind of an inductive learning approach seasoned with *Hebbian Theory*).

However, through the years, and specially during grad school, I became more attracted to [Complexity Theory](#!tags/complexity.md) and self-organization in biological systems (see [autopoiesis](#!tags/autopoiesis.md)), embracing a model closer to the one defended by Francisco Varela and Evan Thompson.

## Notes from Evan Thompson's book "Mind in Life"

### Dynamic Systems and Cognitive Science

> The central idea of the dynamic systems approach is that cognition is an intrinsically temporal phenomenon and accordingly needs to be understood from the perspective of dynamic systems theory. A dynamic systems model takes the form
of a set of evolution equations that describe how the state of the system changes over time. The collection of all possible states of the system corresponds to the system's "state space” or “phase space," and the ways that
the system changes state correspond to trajectories in this space.

> Dynamic-system explanations focus on the internal and external forces that shape such trajectories as they unfold in time. Inputs are described as perturbations to the system's intrinsic dynamics, rather than as instructions to be followed, and internal states are described as self-
organized compensations triggered by perturbations, rather than as representations of external states of affairs.

> The central idea of the embodied approach is that cognition is the exercise of skillful know-how in situated and embodied action. Cognitive structures and processes emerge from recurrent sensorimotor patterns that govern perception and action in autonomous and situated agents. Cognition as skillful know-how is not reducible to prespecified problem solving, because the cognitive system both poses the problems and specifies what actions need to be taken for their solution.

> Strictly speaking, dynamicism and embodiment are logically independent theoretical commitments. For example, dynamical connectionism incorporates dynamicist ideas into artificial neural networks whereas autonomous agents research in robotics incorporates embodiment ideas without ploying dynamic systems theory. 


### Circular causality in neurodynamics

> Emergence through collective self-organization thus has two aspects. One is local-to-global determination, as a result of which novel macrolevel structures and processes emerge. The other is global-to-local determination whereby global structures and processes constrain local interactions. These global-to-local influences do not take the same form as the local-to-global ones: they typically manifest themselves through changes in control parameters. 

> This two-sided or double determination is known as **circular causality**

> Emergence and circular causality are crucially important in the context of neurodynamics. Neuroscience indicates that cognition, emotion, and action require the transient integration of numerous, widely distributed, and constantly interacting brain regions and areas. An outstanding question for neuroscience today is to determine the mechanisms of this large-scale integration.

## Enactivism and Virtual Reality

> The standard approach to immersive virtual reality (VR) is arguably “object-centric” in that it aims to design physically realistic virtual experiences. This article deems the object-centric approach both philosophically and theoretically problematic and builds up to an alternative, “action-predicated” approach, whose aim is to simulate virtual experiences with a primary emphasis on pragmatic functionality instead.
