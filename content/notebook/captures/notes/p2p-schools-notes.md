**Attention!** **This is just a draft.**
 The final project will be eventually published in the SciArt Lab website. Feel free to contact me at xmunch (at) xmunch.com if you want to be part of the conversation. This is a work in progress and we are pretty much open to suggestions. 

# Scope

This project goes beyond the scope of STEAM education, which is one of the points in which the **SciArt Lab** has been usually focused. It is rather intended to define a common infrastructure for a heterogenous ecosystem of learning processes out of traditional school systems.

The idea of the *P2P Schools Framework* begun as a quest for possible answers to our personal problem as parents, which led us to look for a solution extendable to other people in the same situation.

By drafting a framework for a bottom-up learning system within the context of *unschoolers* and *worldschoolers*, we are embracing the ambitious attempt of modeling a network of families and collectives, an ecosystem of **P2P Schools** self-organized by the community of learners. This network can have different kinds of nodes:

  * **Family-managed P2P School:** a family or group of families in which both parent/s and kid/s are part of the maintenance of their own P2P School, sharing time, practices, materials, locations, knowledge, resources, and activities.
  
  * **Collective-managed P2P School** an institution or collective (museum,  hacker space, charity, neighborhood association, activism collective, library...) can manage its own P2P School, providing experiences or resources to other participants in their communities and the network, co-creating a pool of value.

# Target

## First stage

Our initial target are families and communities that have access to traditional schools but are considering something beyond a curricula-oriented schooling and homeschooling model:

* Families who are directly embracing **unschooling** as a way to allow their kids to learn in freedom and explore learning in a self-directed way, guided by their interests and not a pre-design curricula.

* Families who are traveling to different countries during years or months as expats, digital nomads, researchers or activists, and find in **worldschooling** an alternative approach for their kids education.

* Families who are forced to *school* their kids but want to offer them an opportunity to learn after-class in a different way through participatory workshops, DIY commons production, etc... but don't have access to maker spaces / hacker spaces / fablabs. 

In both cases the **P2P Schools** framework should provide value to families' needs, both in the case of:

* Unschoolers: during the time span in which this practice is not illegal (ages vary depending on the country).

* Schoolers: as a complementary tool for self-directed after-class experiences when unschooling is not a possibility.


## Second stage

The framework could be eventually forked and extended to operate off-grid, in order to be fully functional in communities in which, due to geographical circumstances or social problems, there is not access to educational resources (refugees, migrants, off-grid communities...).


# The financial problem 

* P2P Schools should operate in a sustainable way.
* Managing a P2P School should be low cost, and suitable for families living in big cities in which renting a space is not an option, and in which transforming small apartments in maker spaces for kids or exploratory spaces for toddlers not always seems feasible.
* The problem of having one parent out of the job market to attend kids is one of the problems we would like to address. The model project should explore solutions to guarantee a financial income.
