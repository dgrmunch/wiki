## Introduction to the SciArt Lab

**We are a Research and Development Lab for the open exploration of Science, Art and Technology **

* We create open source prototypes, code and ideas to promote STEAM education. 
* We help future hackers to understand the world with DIY experiments. 
* We promote Science, Art and Technology as emancipatory tools. 
* We follow unconventional research approaches to hack seemingly unrelated topics such as virtual reality, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, music, biology, chemistry or digital art. 
* We foster multidisciplinary knowledge and technology-driven creativity, essential cognitive tools for a new generation of critical thinkers and young DIY researchers.
* We enable unconventional DIY research and creative explorations in innovative and unusual ways, hacking traditional ontological and epistemological constraints, building bridges beyond the limits imposed by a specific academic field. Discovering new methods to teach science, understanding the inner nature of social agents, playing with artificial intelligence models, composing music with genetic algorithms, simulating complex adaptive systems, exploring cognitive science with artistic representations or experimenting with new techniques for visual expression through digital photography or virtual reality.
