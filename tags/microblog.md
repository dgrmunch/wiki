White wall. Grey floor. Silence. Impermanence. Life. Breath. Phenomenon.

My photography is usually a non-representational form of exploration. I wish I could grasp the same non-representational nature in written expression. That statement seems an oxymoron though. We can not deny that natural language has a representational nature by default. So maybe conlangs are the only way to overcome linguistic dualism and intrinsic semantic content. Looking for a syntax without meaning. Looking for a picture in words.

In the last couple of days I have experienced a different reality just but letting go reiterative patterns of thought and behavior, trying to train my body to overcome some automatic neurophysiological reactions. 

Changing my *default mode* just by stopping, bracketing the perceived phenomena and trying some diaphragmatic breathing. Decreasing my heart rate through intentional actions has been clearly effective.

Breathing. 3 in/6 out. Breathing.

Bilingual non-native life is a cognitive challenge. It pushes you to live a life with a reduced linguistic toolkit. Sometimes it seems *Tokipona-ish*. A limited English vocabulary/grammar. A lack of phrasal verbs. A broken pronunciation. A non-judgemental understanding of language as a flexible vehicle for communication and experimentation, not for an academic test.

From 2016 to 2018 my photographic style was influenced by the cinematic atmosphere of Gregory Crewdson’s work and the colors of William Magnum’s paintings. My portraits of the American society, from coast to coast, were characterized by highly edited and oversaturated shots. A comic-like visual exploration which combined sociological and ethnographic studies with extremely pushed-to-the-boundary digital editing. Capturing raw reality was less important that capturing my interpretation of that reality, an interpretation full of fascination, color and light. In that sense, my artwork was a mixture of street photography with Lightroom-intense experimentation. Using photography as a tool for drawing with pixels the diversity and complexity of American society.

In 2019 I came back to the U.S. with more nostalgia and familiarity than in my previous stays. The fascination of the newbie, and the over-saturation of my previous digital experiments, was replaced by pure black and white film photography. This time, rather than shooting with my Canon DSLR, I used a 1976 Pentax k1000 to capture my thoughts in film, as a reflection about the lack of temporality in conjunction with the materiality of inhabited spaces. Old film to capture the permanence of Greensboro, our home long time ago.

The more I read about decentralization technology the farther I see massive adoption. Surveillance and manipulation are so embedded in the digital habitat of so many people that they don't actually care about freedom. Sad reality.

Time to close my eyes. Time to not-be. Nothingness. Breath. Bedtime.
