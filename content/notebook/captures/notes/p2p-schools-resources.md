## Future improvements

* The [P2P School](p2p-schools-notes.md) framework could be eventually forked and extended to operate with off-grid nodes, in order to be fully functional in communities without internet connection.
  * Coordination and exchanges mechanism could be accomplished though a *P2P School Ambassadors* program, enabling interactions between communities in an off-the-grid way.
