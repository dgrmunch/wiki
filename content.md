# Content

Consider this *wiki* a *commonplace book* with a rhizomatic structure. 

You can read it following your own intuition rather than any predefined chronological or index-based order. 

There is not a static navigation map, but rather as many pathways as you consider necessary to understand and decipher its content. 

The following table can be an useful starting point though. The content is distributed in different type-nodes:

| Node        | Description |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
|  [Concepts](content/concepts.md)    | General ideas and philosophical statements.  Remember to navigate these concepts in any order, following the links you feel more attracted to. |
|  [Articles](content/articles.md)    | In this node you can find links to my research papers and academic articles. Posts from my blogs can also be found here. Most of the content is in English, but some articles in Spanish are provided too. |
|  [Projects](content/projects.md)    | A summary of Research & Development Projects, Open Source repositories and Artwork. This section is a common place to share my R&D projects, but also my experiments as a digital artist, my photographic work and both musical and visual arts projects.
|  [Notebook](content/notebook.md)  | Quotes, personal notes, recommended readings, text comments, drafts and raw ideas |
|  [Recipes](content/recipes.md)    | Technical recipes / IT Miscellanea / HOW TOs |
