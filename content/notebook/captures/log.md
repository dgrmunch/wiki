## Greensboro - Nov 15th 2019

 > **Thought:** Yesterday we came back to North Carolina after two years living in Spain. Greensboro, the city which was twice our home, is welcoming us back for the third time. Walking around. Breathing under a rainbow of autumn leaves. Friends and relatives. Smells. Sounds. Hugs. Everything seems like it was when we left. Continuity. Sense of permanence. I literally feel that time did not pass by. Our life is still here. A life which ended with tears in our eyes. A life which disappeared when we took that plane with a set of promises and a suitcase full of memories. A goodbye which lead to a cultural reverse shock and several months of re-adaptation to the Spanish culture. Rhizome. Lack of temporality. Loop. Here we are. Breathing. Alive.


## America through photography I

 > **Thought:** From 2016 to 2018 my photographic style was influenced by the cinematic atmosphere of Gregory Crewdson’s work and the colors of William Magnum’s paintings. My portraits of the American society, from coast to coast, were characterized by highly edited and oversaturated shots. A comic-like visual exploration which combined sociological and ethnographic studies with extremely pushed-to-the-boundary digital editing. Capturing raw reality was less important that capturing my interpretation of that reality, an interpretation full of fascination, color and light. In that sense, my artwork was a mixture of street photography with Lightroom-intense experimentation. Using photography as a tool for drawing with pixels the diversity and complexity of American society. 


## America Through Photography II

 > **Thought:** In 2019 I came back to the U.S. with more nostalgia and familiarity than in my previous stays. The fascination of the newbie, and the over-saturation of my previous digital experiments, was replaced by pure black and white film photography. This time, rather than shooting with my Canon DSLR, I used a 1976 Pentax k1000 to capture my thoughts in film, as a reflection about the lack of temporality in conjunction with the materiality of inhabited spaces. Old film to capture the permanence of Greensboro, our home long time ago.


## Improving note-taking flow

In order to improve my note-taking flow, and automatically append thoughts, tasks, ideas, quotes or resources to the *Notebook* section of my **Commonplace book / personal wiki**, I decided to implement an easy-to-manage system based on already existing software. I have been doing some testing of my Automation Flow through *iOS Shortcuts* + *Dropbox sync* + a Unix Cron + my pCloud public folder and it works pretty well.

Possible Worlds
WHY DO CHILDREN PRETEND?
uman beings don't live in the real world. The real world is
what actually happened in the past, is happening now,
and will happen in the future. But we don't just live in
this single world. Instead, we live in a universe of many possible
worlds, all the ways the world could be in the future and also all
the ways the world could have been in the past, or might be in the
present. These possible worlds are what we call dreams and plans,
fictions and hypotheses. They are the products of hope and imag-
ination. Philosophers, more drily, call them "counterfactuals."
Counterfactuals are the woulda-coulda-shouldas of life, all the
things that might happen in the future, but haven't yet, or that
could have happened in the past, but didn't quite. Human beings
care deeply about those possible worlds-as deeply as they care
about the real actual world. On the surface counterfactual think-
ing seems like a very sophisticated and philosophically puzzling
ability. How can we think about things that aren't there? And why
should we think this way instead of restricting ourselves to the
actual world? It seems obvious that understanding the real world
