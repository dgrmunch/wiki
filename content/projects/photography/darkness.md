## Description

> You, darkness, that I come from

> I love you more than all the fires

> that fence in the world, 

> for the fire makes a circle of light for everyone

> and then no one outside learns of you. 

> But the darkness pulls in everything-

> shapes and fires, animals and myself, 

> how easily it gathers them! -
> powers and people-

> and it is possible a great presence is moving near me. 

> I have faith in nights.                        

**Rainer Maria Rilke**

---

Sometimes I feel extremely alive when the daylight is gone. 
There is only silence, calm, oneness. Just some subtle shadows dancing in the wall, just some dimmed lights coming through the window.  

There is something mysterious in darkness. There is a hidden potential in the black film, in the black sensor. 

Pixels waiting to be painted. Stories waiting to be said. 

Characters disappear while the pure [self](../../concepts/identity.md) (or non-self) shows up.
