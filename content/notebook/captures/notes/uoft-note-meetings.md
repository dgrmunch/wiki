During my time in the University of Toronto I had several meetings and conversations with different scholars. Even a coffee with Barry Wellman. Here I have some of my notes of that time.

## Barry Wellman: notes from meetings

* I discussed with Barry how to connect the idea P2P Societies with its sociological data

* I have been working with agent-based modeling to study CAS and I observed that, in my models, "artificial societies" become more resilient if the variables related with both functional diversity and structural decentralization have higher values. There are several attributes related with those aspects but, basically, they are related with how information flows between nodes in heterogeneous and distributed networks. 

* According to my models, CAS would evolve becoming less homogeneous and centralized. Barry finds this point very interesting and in line with his work.

* We have found some common points with "networked individualism" such as the shift from social centralization in groups to overlapped networks.

  > At first glance, Lee Rainie and Barry Wellman’s Networked—The New Social Operating System follows a growing academic trend: that of the application of network theories to different levels of social experience, if not to society at large. The three revolutions to which the authors refer—the rise of social networking, the consolidation of the Internet, the always-on connectivity of mobile devices—contribute to shape a new social order, that is, an “operating system” combining technical possibilities and everyday practices.

## Rhonda McEwen: notes from meetings

* Take into account her methodology.
* Good recommendations about population and sampling
* Quotes:

> "In network analysis terms I specified the network boundary as an analytical
demarcation of who could participate in the study and who could not based on a
nominalist approach. In a nominialist approach, the boundary is based on the line of
inquiry for this study as opposed to a more physical boundary such as geography. There
is a single actor set who are the one entity on which structural variables were set and me
asured."

> "According to Hogan, Carrasco & Wellman (2007), most researchers conducting
personal network studies gather their data by surveying a random sample of a population.
Increasing the diversity of the sample increases the validity and potential to make
inferences about the wider population of actors from the sample. Also, when deal
ing with the set of alters connected to an ego in a personal network, the respondent is often the only informant on this network (Hogan et al 2007). In order to manage the recall of the
respondent during data collection, name generators, visualization techniques and
secondary documentary sources were incorporated to improve reliability."

> "Most of the methods commonly used in social science research such as surveys,
ethnographic interviews, semi-structured interviews and observation and documentary
analysis are used to collect relationship data using a social network analysis approach"
