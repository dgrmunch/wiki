    def "it should verify the number of hands of our team"() {
        
		given: "Docuten has 9 people in the IT team"
		    
                    def i = 9

		when: "Each member has 2 hands"

		    i = i * 2

		then: "The expected number of hands to code is 18"
    
                    assert i == 18
