## Description

This is a list of notes taken from my phone.

It is structured as an append-only log, with the latest notes in the bottom of the list.



## Greensboro - Nov 15th 2019

 > **Thought:** Yesterday we came back to North Carolina after two years living in Spain. Greensboro, the city which was twice our home, is welcoming us back for the third time. Walking around. Breathing under a rainbow of autumn leaves. Friends and relatives. Smells. Sounds. Hugs. Everything seems like it was when we left. Continuity. Sense of permanence. I literally feel that time did not pass by. Our life is still here. A life which ended with tears in our eyes. A life which disappeared when we took that plane with a set of promises and a suitcase full of memories. A goodbye which lead to a cultural reverse shock and several months of re-adaptation to the Spanish culture. Rhizome. Lack of temporality. Loop. Here we are. Breathing. Alive.


## America through photography I

 > **Thought:** From 2016 to 2018 my photographic style was influenced by the cinematic atmosphere of Gregory Crewdson’s work and the colors of William Magnum’s paintings. My portraits of the American society, from coast to coast, were characterized by highly edited and oversaturated shots. A comic-like visual exploration which combined sociological and ethnographic studies with extremely pushed-to-the-boundary digital editing. Capturing raw reality was less important that capturing my interpretation of that reality, an interpretation full of fascination, color and light. In that sense, my artwork was a mixture of street photography with Lightroom-intense experimentation. Using photography as a tool for drawing with pixels the diversity and complexity of American society. 


## America Through Photography II

 > **Thought:** In 2019 I came back to the U.S. with more nostalgia and familiarity than in my previous stays. The fascination of the newbie, and the over-saturation of my previous digital experiments, was replaced by pure black and white film photography. This time, rather than shooting with my Canon DSLR, I used a 1976 Pentax k1000 to capture my thoughts in film, as a reflection about the lack of temporality in conjunction with the materiality of inhabited spaces. Old film to capture the permanence of Greensboro, our home long time ago.


## Improving note-taking flow

In order to improve my note-taking flow, and automatically append thoughts, tasks, ideas, quotes or resources to the *Notebook* section of my **Commonplace book / personal wiki**, I decided to implement an easy-to-manage system based on already existing software. I have been doing some testing of my Automation Flow through *iOS Shortcuts* + *Dropbox sync* + a Unix Cron + my pCloud public folder and it works pretty well.

Cany, Irom Husserl's notion of "tran-
scendence within immanence." (Dupuy 2000, pp. 104–105)

Because this notion of transcendence-within-immanence is often
misunderstood, it bears clarification here. It does not mean
Bears to be beyond or outside the sphere of mental activity is really
contained within the mind in some idealist or internalist sense).
Rather, the crucial point is that the transcendent is given as such by
virtue of the intentional activities of consciousness. Thus it falls
within the sphere of what is phenomenologically constituted (dis-
closed or brought to awareness by consciousness). Clearly, this point
makes sense only at a transcendental level, for at this level the tran-
scendent is understood as a mode of givenness or disclosure (one char-
acterizing things in the world, but not one's own consciousness).
Thus, at a transcendental level, what is really or genuinely transcendent
is also phenomenologically immanent (see Crowell, in press, for further
discussion).
The correspondence between phenomenology and dynamic systems
theory to which Dupuy is pointing should therefore be understood as
follows. External events are really transcendent, for they are certainly not
contained within the system, nor are they a mere product of what goes
inside the system. Nevertheless, they are intentionally immanent, in the
following sense: they do not arrive already labeled, as it were, as ex-
ternal events; instead they are constituted or disclosed as such, and
with the significance they have, by virtue of the network's autonomous
(self-organizing) dynamics. In other words, their status as external
events for the system (as opposed to their status for an observer of the
system) is a function of the system's own activity. Their meaning or sig-
nificance corresponds to an attractor of the system's dynamics (a re-
current pattern of activity toward which the system tends), which itself
is an emergent product of that very dynamics. The external world is
constituted as such for the system by virtue of the system's self-
organizing activity. Dupuy's proposal, in a nutshell, is that constitutional
intentionality corresponds to a kind of self-organization. This proposal, as we
will see in later chapters, is one of the key guiding intuitions of the en-
active approach and neurophenomenology.

Husserl's terms horizon and ground are metaphorical, at once you
and geological. A horizon is not a thing "out there” but rather a struc-
ture of appearance. It therefore implicates or points back to the per-
ceiver for whom appearances are so structured. In phenomenological
language, “horizon” taken noematically as a structure of appearance
necessarily implicates “horizon” taken noetically as a structure of con-
sciousness. One could say that a horizon is the precondition for the ap-
pearance of anything, except that “precondition" is too static. Stated
in a genetic register, a horizon is a dynamic structure of disclosure in
which both the object (noema) and consciousness (noesis) partake
(Steinbock 1995, p. 107). Anything that comes forth, manifests, or
emerges does so in an open clearing or expanse, delimited by a
