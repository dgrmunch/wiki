## Description

In order to properly understand the complexity of any social agent, it is important to dig into the pathways it[*](../notebook/pronouns.md) went through. 

Pathways are part of the [rhizome](rhizome.md) and constitute a set of chronological structures, a multidimensional scaffold of personal narratives.

The social agent is an overlay of several _characters_ that, even though sometimes are wrongly identified with a uniform personal [identity](identity.md), really correspond to a variety of context-based snapshots, several "personas" or adaptations that a social agent embodies through its life. 

The existence of all the *characters* we *play/become/identify with* during our biography takes place within a specific space-and-time span. 

The pathways a human being goes through and the characters it embodies can be therefore easily logged through visual representations. Bi-dimensional geo-spatial maps with simple lines representing time transitions can be considered a valid complementary tool to text descriptions and photographs.

Topographical representations of the pathways can help to visualize and understand the complexity of the different personal transitions, the overlay of *characters* and experiential layers. 

In that regard, pathways can be drawn or described within the context of a specific field of interest. Even though the whole social experience of the agent has a topology with [rhizomatic](rhizome.md) structure, personal narratives are usually filtered or simplified based on the context. For example, the narrative of a social agent does not necessary need a complete biological description when somebody is only interested in understanding a professional curriculum. 

As any other social agent, the author of this notes also has a set of personal paths. 

According to what was previously said, I have created a navigation map in the [about me](../../about.md) section to explore my own pathways through a variety of maps, from curricular to philosophical, from geographical to political. 

You can [browse them](../../about.md)  in order to understand better my philosophical thought and have a general view of the personal and professional experiences which ended up in the content of this wiki.
