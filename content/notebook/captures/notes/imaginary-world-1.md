> Imaginary worlds are cognitive gates towards our true phenomenological potential. They let us explore the nature of subjective ontologies in a virtual universe that do not have any correspondence with our objective reality. They truly become actual worlds in the experience of the thinker, the observer, the reader, the creator. 

> These narrative experiments constitute the starting point of a variety of unfolding ontologies, of distinct and parallel universes full of creative and philosophical possibilities.

> My synthetic multiverse is mainly text-based but it is inevitably interwoven with visual artwork, music, coding, and constructed language explorations. 


## A three-layers model

## { World-000 }

`Vraj` is a biological entity, an inhabitant of `{ World-000 }`. 

In this world, `Vraj` manifests itself through a bipedal morphology with a performative nature, characterized by a set of physiological and psychological needs and different layers of self-organized molecular, cellular and neural aggregates. 

`Vraj` manifests in `{ World-000 }` through an organic character, through a viscous, tangible and dynamic avatar.  As a biological and social entity, `Vraj`'s organic substrate is projected in the social playground through context-based behavior.

`Vraj`learns about the `{ World-000 }` through a sequential and vivid stream of sensory stimuli, nociception, emotions and episodic memories.

`Vraj` adapts to a given environment through interactions with objects and other beings, playing social roles and using natural languages for communication, enjoying the motor, cognitive and perceptual advantages of its species; but also misguided by cognitive biases and evolutionary vestiges that are encoded in its genome and neural networks. 

In this world, nobody knows the whole individuality that `Vraj` embodies, but just the visual side of this organic character, this projection, this performative avatar.

However, `Vraj` knows how to navigate different worlds and how to open the portals between them. 

`Vraj` applies all the knowledge from `{ World-001 }` and `{ World-002 }` in its interactions with others and tries to transform the physical environment of  `{ World-000 }` according to its inner values.

This schematic description describes some of the cognitive triggers that encode the portals between worlds that `Vraj` knows.

## { World-001 }

`Vraj` is the only perceptor in `Phej`, and its mainly task is to keep the balance of the `World`, trying to compensate the natural emergence of chaos and the dominance of `Noise` over `Music`.

It is also in charge of keeping the `Outers` out of `Phej`, focusing on taking its own decisions based on its needs, wishes and temporary preferences.

Its main skill is to skip cognitive biases, substituting fake narratives by alternative thoughts when exaggerated emotions are detected. `Vraj` analyzes perceptual inputs and redirects synaptic signals based on a complex process based on phenomenological training and self-awareness. 

Since it embraced monastic life, `Vraj` performs a continuous process of rearrangement, keeping things in order day after day. It keeps `Phej` in equilibrium, like a postmodern Sisyphus, but surrounded by minimal techno, post-rock and the possibility of traveling to `{ World-002 }` when the `Circle` is open.

It lives a minimal life dedicated to serving `Phej` and studying `tze`.

## { World-002} 

* There is nothingness (`tze`)
* `Vraj` is perceiving that nothingness
* ` {World-001} ` interferences take place, like green clouds on a black sky.
* `Vraj` ignores the green clouds.
* Timeless perception of `tze`.
* Darkness. Nothingness.
