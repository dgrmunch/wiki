> Imaginary worlds are cognitive gates towards our true phenomenological potential. They let us explore the nature of subjective ontologies in a virtual universe that do not have any correspondence with our objective reality. They truly become actual worlds in the experience of the thinker, the observer, the reader, the creator. 

> These narrative experiments constitute the starting point of a variety of unfolding ontologies, of distinct and parallel universes full of creative and philosophical possibilities.

> My synthetic multiverse is mainly text-based but it is inevitably interwoven with visual artwork, music, coding, and constructed language explorations.

*{Vraj}* is the only monk of the *{Circle}*, and his mainly task is to keep the balance of the *{Temple}*, trying to compensate the natural emergence of chaos after the *{Collapse}*. 

He usually finds himself in a continuous process of rearrangement, keeping things in order day after day. He is like a postmodern Sisyphus, but surrounded by marihuana, minimal techno, post-rock and the possibility of connecting with the guys of the *{Underground}* when the *{Door}* is open.
