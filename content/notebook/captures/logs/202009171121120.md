My photography is usually a non-representational form of exploration. I wish I could grasp the same non-representational nature in written expression. That statement seems an oximoron though. We can not deny that natural language has a representational nature by default. So maybe conlangs are the only way to overcome linguistic dualism and intrinsic semantic content. Looking for a syntax without meaning. Looking for a picture in words.
