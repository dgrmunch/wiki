## Description

*Sense-making* could basically be described as a gradual understanding of the environment in which we are immersed. 

## Uncertainty reduction vs self-reinforcement

Initially, *sense-making* could be perceived as a process for knowledge acquisition, as a way to reduce uncertainty **^**. 

 > **^** Even if this assumption could be plausible, it could lead to the identification of learning as a biological mechanism for the purpose of entropy reduction in cognitive systems. That would necessarily imply a teleology and I am not a big fan of it. So we would consider that statement just as a possibility.

I rather understand sense-making as a trial and error challenge by which cognitive agents **accommodate new inputs to previously existing knowledge models**. 

In that regard, if the agent is empowered with cognitive tools such as **critical thinking**, probably its[*](../notebook/bilingualism/pronouns.md) model of the world could generally describe the actual material reality, although only under the circumstances of a given perception and a historical context.

If its[*](../notebook/bilingualism/pronouns.md) observations are matched against the scientific method, or any methodological paradigm endowed with verifiability and falsifiability, the correlation between reality and *sense-making* outcomes would be even more reliable.

However, even in those cases, social agents are just:

a) Individually: Trying to accommodate new experiences to previously existing self-reinforced narratives according to their personal [identities](identity.md) and their [subjective ontology](subjective_ontology.md).

b) Collectively: Trying to define a common notion of truth through generalized empirical evidence or through [consensus](consensus.md) (ethics, ideologies, religions, scientific theories).

At the end, *sense-making* is **an attempt** to achieve an individual and collective understanding of the world. However, this gradual acquisition of knowledge could just be a continuous fight to justify our previous preconceptions, expectations, believes, prejudices, plans or goals. Not necessarily a pathway towards any uppercase-truth but rather a struggle to maintain the foundations of our [identity](identity.md).

We can even argue that often, even obvious facts generally accepted as objective truths are directly ignored by large numbers of people just because they don’t fit in their believe systems. From a darwinian perspective, our [subjective ontology](subjective_ontology.md) fights for its survival; somehow as the memes of Richard Dawkins. 

Ideologies, religions and social or economic paradigms often constitute the foundation of our [*knowledge tree*](rhizomatic_epistemology.md). Therefore, our mind initially rejects any input which could be perceived a a threat (see the Wikipedia list of [cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)). 


## Are other approaches possible when talking about sense-making?

* A [phenomenological attitude](phenomenology.md) and a [rhizomatic epistemology](rhizomatic_epistemology.md) could revert this trend of self-reinforcement and dogmatic attitudes. 

* Radical experiences like the [*situated epoché*](../articles/situated.md) could completely overtake our model of reality and induce another attitude towards phenomena.

* [Visual Koans](visual_koan.md) can be a trigger for thoughtless experiences in which intuition can lead to interesting openness regarding both sensual perception and internal narratives.
