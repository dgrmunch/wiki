## Introduction to the SciArt Lab

**We are a Research and Development Lab for the open exploration of Science, Art and Technology **

* We create open source prototypes, code and ideas to promote STEAM education. 
* We help future hackers to understand the world with DIY experiments. 
* We promote Science, Art and Technology as emancipatory tools. 
* We follow unconventional research approaches to hack seemingly unrelated topics such as virtual reality, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, music, biology, chemistry or digital art. 
* We foster multidisciplinary knowledge and technology-driven creativity, essential cognitive tools for a new generation of critical thinkers and young DIY researchers.
