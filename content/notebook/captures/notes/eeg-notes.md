## Introduction 

For some time I have been thinking about buying EEG hardware in order to do some [neuroscience](#!tags/neuroscience.md) research for the [SciArt Lab](http://sciartlab.com).

That would allow us to perform our SciArt experiments with a [neurophenomenological](#!tags/neurophenomenology.md) approach in combination with our virtual reality technology and our STEAM educational events. I am particularly interested in the phenomenological aspects of visual perception, specially in VR, artistic production and photography. 

The possibility of getting an affordable neuroscience equipment would allow us to extract raw data from situated/embodied experiences, giving us the possibility of correlating neural activity (see [ERP](#!tags/erp.md)s and [brain waves](#!tags/brain waves.md)) with sensory stimuli within the context of SciArt experiments.

The use of neuroscience to *naturalize* [phenomenological](#!tags/neurophenomenology.md) descriptions within a more analytical framework with actual brain data would really give us a potential tool. 

Additionally, if the EEG device is wireless or easy to carry and we could perform *out-of-the-lab* experiments, capturing data about situations in which embodiment and immersion are crucial, providing a valuable tool to study [situated cognition](#!tags/situated.md).

The whole point so far is about funding. Therefore, right now I am interested in the research possibilities of low-cost EEG, even though this would imply thinking about dramatically reducing the number of EEG channels.


## Backyard Brains and DIY Neuroscience

I remember that some years ago, I was walking with my wife through campus of the *University of Michigan* in Ann Arbor. We were sharing deep thoughts and engaged in a conversation about our life and our future research, discussing the potential possibilities of the [Sciart Lab](http://sciartlab.com), what at that time was just in its first steps. 

It was raining but we kept walking and talking. Eventually, we found a sticker on one wall about *Backyard Brains*, an biotech company born in Ann Arbor. It was co-founded by Greg Gage, currently Adjunct Professor in the Department of Molecular & Integrative Physiology at the University of Michigan, and Timothy Marzullo, the current Chief Scientific Officer of the company, who also got his PhD in Neuroscience in town.

The sticker triggered some memories about a fascinating talk I watched time before, in which they showed how to remotely control a cockroach by using low-cost electronics and easy-to-use software for *DIY neuroscience*.

At the end, Backyard Brains was bringing the "making/hacking" mindset to a field traditionally restrained to academic or medical institutions. That was fascinating and I thought that, one day, we would talk to them and test some of their hardware.

Probably that time will come soon, depending on the needs and the funding (not a lot so far). 


### Needs and hardware

> The general feeling in the research community is not a lot but more and more people are betting on “more data” over “good data”. Consumer grade products already exist such as Neurosky the original single channel system) and Muse and Melon (3-4 electrodes as far as I can tell). With these devices the emphasis is on making it easy to use and cheap enough for consumer apps and I think there is a lot of value in this (it will drive down costs) but the most interesting (and perhaps controversial) example is the iBrain form NeuroVigil. Founder Philip Low claims to be able to classify brain states and responses with a single channel that other groups have been struggling with using dense EEG arrays for many years. The work is based on his PhD which recently became public after a long patent related embargo and appears to be a simple classification of states based on the most prevalent frequency band in a normalised spectrum for a given epoch (using epochs of 30s). What’s interesting is that the classification is in temporal space although the feature is in frequency space.
