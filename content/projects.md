## Personal projects

### Photography

Photography is my main artistic tool. Considering the growing amount of artistic projects I have been working on during the last years, I've created a [specific page](projects/photography.md) for a selection of them.

### Video / Documentary

#### Latest

##### - [Looking for Identity](https://youtu.be/1rUHNIJ7rn0) (English)

> Visual ethnography with a film-making approach to explore multiculturalism and individual/social identity in the context of the U.S.A.

This movie was a project I develop some years ago while living in America. It talks about the American identity from a multicultural point of view. 

Some controversial issues are exposed, presenting a nation with a heterogeneous society, a complex and evolving multi-ethnic identity and a conflict of cultural forces and discourses.

In the moment of historic change in which this has been filmed (2016-2017), the U.S.A. faces a moment of transformation and tensions between a national identity and a large number of racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic identities, between assimilation and intercultural engagement.

#### Older

My former hand-held camera documentaries are both in Spanish.

The quality of the final products is not very good, considering that the resources that I had at that time were so much limited. No DSLR, no lenses, no microphone, no tripod, no plan. Just a hand-held HD camera, a laptop for post-production and a hard story.  But I consider both of them two unique visual ethnographies to understand better two very different realities.
