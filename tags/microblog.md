Home Daily routines as a homeostatic process. Keep it organized. Keep it minimal. Keep it uncluttered. **Keep it in balance.**

Time to close my eyes. Time to not-be. Nothingness. Breath. Bedtime.

The more I read about decentralization technology the farther I see massive adoption. Surveillance and manipulation are so embedded in the digital habitat of so many people that they don't actually care about freedom. Sad reality.

Bilingual non-native life is a cognitive challenge. It pushes you to live a life with a reduced linguistic toolkit. Sometimes it seems *Tokipona-ish*. A limited English vocabulary/grammar. A lack of phrasal verbs. A broken pronunciation. A non-judgemental understanding of language as a flexible vehicle for communication and experimentation, not for an academic test.

In the last couple of days I have experienced a different reality just but letting go reiterative patterns of thought and behavior, trying to train my body to overcome some automatic neurophysiological reactions. 

Changing my *default mode* just by stopping, bracketing the perceived phenomena and trying some diaphragmatic breathing. Decreasing my heart rate through intentional actions has been clearly effective.

Breathing. 3 in/6 out. Breathing.
