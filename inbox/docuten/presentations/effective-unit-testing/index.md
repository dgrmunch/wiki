# Cool! So...

 The point is that we can (and should) use tests as a **design tool**

import spock.lang.Specification

class DocuTeamSpec extends Specification {

    def "it should verify the number of hands of our team"() {

                    def i = 9

		when: "Each member has 2 hands"

		    i = i * 2

                    assert i == 18

 ### Test Doubles

<br>

![](images/person-flat.png)  ![](images/person-flat.png)

# Taxonomy of test doubles

* Test Stub
* Fake Object
* Test Spy
* Mock Object


---

# Test Stub
Test stubs are unusually short things

  ```
  public class LoggerStub implements Logger { 
	public void log(LogLevel level, String message) { 
		//Do nothing
	} 
}
```
---

# Fake Object

Fake objects do it without side effects

  ```
  public class FakeUserRepository implements UserRepository { 

	  private Collection<User> users = new ArrayList<User>();

	  public void save(User user) { 
		  if (findById(user.getId()) == null)  users.add(user);
	  }

	  public User findById(long id) { 		
		for (User user : users) { 
		   if (user.getId() == id) return user;
		}
		return null; 
	} 
}
```
---
# Test Spies
These guys steal your secrets


  ```
  public void filter(List<?> list, Predicate<?> predicate) { ... }

  // How can I test this method if none of the objects can
  // reveal what happens inside?
  
```

**Override an internal method and verify what it does**

---

### Almost mocks?

> In short, test spies are test doubles built to record whatâ€™s happening with them so that the test will know afterward what happened. Sometimes we take this concept farther and **our test spies become full-blown mock objects.**

Jumping out of the book...

Let's ask God, aka Martin Fowler :)

> Only mocks insist upon **behavior verification**. The other doubles can, and usually do, use **state verification** [...] mocks differ in the setup and the verification phases.

---

Basically, the idea is that Mocks's methods are not modified, but rather just verified. We are interested in **behavior verification**.

---

Using an example in Spock:

```

given:

 	def invoice = Mock(EditionInvoice)

when:

 	invoice.send()

then:

 	1 * invoice.doAfterSending()
 	1 * invoice.notifyReceptor()

```
