During my time in the University of Toronto I had several meetings and conversations with different scholars. Even a coffee with Barry Wellman. Here I have some of my notes of that time.

### Barry Wellman: notes from meetings

* I discussed with Barry how to connect the idea P2P Societies with its sociological data

* I have been working with agent-based modeling to study CAS and I observed that, in my models, "artificial societies" become more resilient if the variables related with both functional diversity and structural decentralization have higher values. There are several attributes related with those aspects but, basically, they are related with how information flows between nodes in heterogeneous and distributed networks. 

* According to my models, CAS would evolve becoming less homogeneous and centralized. Barry finds this point very interesting and in line with his work.

* We have found some common points with "networked individualism" such as the shift from social centralization in groups to overlapped networks.

  > At first glance, Lee Rainie and Barry Wellman’s Networked—The New Social Operating System follows a growing academic trend: that of the application of network theories to different levels of social experience, if not to society at large. The three revolutions to which the authors refer—the rise of social networking, the consolidation of the Internet, the always-on connectivity of mobile devices—contribute to shape a new social order, that is, an “operating system” combining technical possibilities and everyday practices.

### Rhonda McEwen: notes from meetings

* Take into account her methodology.
* Good recommendations about population and sampling
* Quotes:

> "In network analysis terms I specified the network boundary as an analytical
demarcation of who could participate in the study and who could not based on a
nominalist approach. In a nominialist approach, the boundary is based on the line of
inquiry for this study as opposed to a more physical boundary such as geography. There
is a single actor set who are the one entity on which structural variables were set and me
asured."

> "According to Hogan, Carrasco & Wellman (2007), most researchers conducting
personal network studies gather their data by surveying a random sample of a population.
Increasing the diversity of the sample increases the validity and potential to make
inferences about the wider population of actors from the sample. Also, when deal
ing with the set of alters connected to an ego in a personal network, the respondent is often the only informant on this network (Hogan et al 2007). In order to manage the recall of the
respondent during data collection, name generators, visualization techniques and
secondary documentary sources were incorporated to improve reliability."

> "Most of the methods commonly used in social science research such as surveys,
ethnographic interviews, semi-structured interviews and observation and documentary
analysis are used to collect relationship data using a social network analysis approach"

### Other notes 

* Brian C. Smith
  * Read "The foundations of computing"

* **Emergence and Embodiment: New Essays on Second-Order Systems Theory**, 2009. Editor(s): Bruce Clarke, Mark B. N. Hansen. Contributor(s): Bruce Clarke, Francisco J. Varela, Evan Thompson, John Protevi, Niklas Luhmann, Michael Schiltz, Edgar Landgraf, Linda Brigham, Ira Livingstone, Mark B. N. Hansen, Cary Wolfe

> Emerging in the 1940s, the first cybernetics—the study of communication and control systems—was mainstreamed under the names artificial intelligence and computer science and taken up by the social sciences, the humanities, and the creative arts. In Emergence and Embodiment, Bruce Clarke and Mark B. N. Hansen focus on cybernetic developments that stem from the second-order turn in the 1970s, when the cyberneticist Heinz von Foerster catalyzed new thinking about the cognitive implications of self-referential systems. The crucial shift he inspired was from first-order cybernetics’ attention to homeostasis as a mode of autonomous self-regulation in mechanical and informatic systems, to second-order concepts of self-organization and autopoiesis in embodied and metabiotic systems. The collection opens with an interview with von Foerster and then traces the lines of neocybernetic thought that have followed from his work. In response to the apparent dissolution of boundaries at work in the contemporary technosciences of emergence, neocybernetics observes that cognitive systems are operationally bounded, semi-autonomous entities coupled with their environments and other systems. Second-order systems theory stresses the recursive complexities of observation, mediation, and communication. Focused on the neocybernetic contributions of von Foerster, Francisco Varela, and Niklas Luhmann, this collection advances theoretical debates about the cultural, philosophical, and literary uses of their ideas. In addition to the interview with von Foerster, Emergence and Embodiment includes essays by Varela and Luhmann. It engages with Humberto Maturana’s and Varela’s creation of the concept of autopoiesis, Varela’s later work on neurophenomenology, and Luhmann’s adaptations of autopoiesis to social systems theory. Taken together, these essays illuminate the shared commitments uniting the broader discourse of neocybernetics.

      * "Jonathan Tudge is Professor in the Department of Human Development and Family Studies at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Most of his research focuses on the interrelations between the social world and children’s social, moral, and cognitive development. In much of his research, he uses cultural-ecological theory, a contextualist theory that draws on the ideas of Lev Vygotsky and Urie Bronfenbrenner. The major line of research is longitudinal and cross-cultural in design, dealing with the ways in which young children become part of the cultural group in which they live. This work involves extensive observations of the everyday activities of children when they are three years of age as well as interviews and questionnaires with their parents regarding their child-rearing values and beliefs. The children are followed through their first years of school, when data on parents’ and teachers’ perceptions of the children’s social and academic competence are also gathered. This research is cross-cultural (US, Russia, Estonia, Finland, Korea, Kenya, and Brazil) and examines within-societal variations as a function of ethnicity and social class. A book was published that is based on this research: Tudge, J. R. H. (2008). The everyday lives of young children: Culture, class, and child rearing in diverse societies.
