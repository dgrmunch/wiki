This is a list of notes taken from my phone.

It is structured as an append-only log, with the latest notes in the bottom of the list.



## Greensboro - Nov 15th 2019

 > **Thought:** Yesterday we came back to North Carolina after two years living in Spain. Greensboro, the city which was twice our home, is welcoming us back for the third time. Walking around. Breathing under a rainbow of autumn leaves. Friends and relatives. Smells. Sounds. Hugs. Everything seems like it was when we left. Continuity. Sense of permanence. I literally feel that time did not pass by. Our life is still here. A life which ended with tears in our eyes. A life which disappeared when we took that plane with a set of promises and a suitcase full of memories. A goodbye which lead to a cultural reverse shock and several months of re-adaptation to the Spanish culture. Rhizome. Lack of temporality. Loop. Here we are. Breathing. Alive.


## America through photography I

 > **Thought:** From 2016 to 2018 my photographic style was influenced by the cinematic atmosphere of Gregory Crewdson’s work and the colors of William Magnum’s paintings. My portraits of the American society, from coast to coast, were characterized by highly edited and oversaturated shots. A comic-like visual exploration which combined sociological and ethnographic studies with extremely pushed-to-the-boundary digital editing. Capturing raw reality was less important that capturing my interpretation of that reality, an interpretation full of fascination, color and light. In that sense, my artwork was a mixture of street photography with Lightroom-intense experimentation. Using photography as a tool for drawing with pixels the diversity and complexity of American society. 


## America Through Photography II

 > **Thought:** In 2019 I came back to the U.S. with more nostalgia and familiarity than in my previous stays. The fascination of the newbie, and the over-saturation of my previous digital experiments, was replaced by pure black and white film photography. This time, rather than shooting with my Canon DSLR, I used a 1976 Pentax k1000 to capture my thoughts in film, as a reflection about the lack of temporality in conjunction with the materiality of inhabited spaces. Old film to capture the permanence of Greensboro, our home long time ago.


## Improving note-taking flow

In order to improve my note-taking flow, and automatically append thoughts, tasks, ideas, quotes or resources to the *Notebook* section of my **Commonplace book / personal wiki**, I decided to implement an easy-to-manage system based on already existing software. I have been doing some testing of my Automation Flow through *iOS Shortcuts* + *Dropbox sync* + a Unix Cron + my pCloud public folder and it works pretty well.

Because this notion of transcendence-within-immanence is often
misunderstood, it bears clarification here. It does not mean
Bears to be beyond or outside the sphere of mental activity is really
contained within the mind in some idealist or internalist sense).
Rather, the crucial point is that the transcendent is given as such by
virtue of the intentional activities of consciousness. Thus it falls
within the sphere of what is phenomenologically constituted (dis-
closed or brought to awareness by consciousness). Clearly, this point
makes sense only at a transcendental level, for at this level the tran-
scendent is understood as a mode of givenness or disclosure (one char-
acterizing things in the world, but not one's own consciousness).
Thus, at a transcendental level, what is really or genuinely transcendent
is also phenomenologically immanent (see Crowell, in press, for further
discussion).
The correspondence between phenomenology and dynamic systems
theory to which Dupuy is pointing should therefore be understood as
follows. External events are really transcendent, for they are certainly not
contained within the system, nor are they a mere product of what goes
inside the system. Nevertheless, they are intentionally immanent, in the
following sense: they do not arrive already labeled, as it were, as ex-
ternal events; instead they are constituted or disclosed as such, and
with the significance they have, by virtue of the network's autonomous
(self-organizing) dynamics. In other words, their status as external
events for the system (as opposed to their status for an observer of the
system) is a function of the system's own activity. Their meaning or sig-
nificance corresponds to an attractor of the system's dynamics (a re-
current pattern of activity toward which the system tends), which itself
is an emergent product of that very dynamics. The external world is
constituted as such for the system by virtue of the system's self-
organizing activity. Dupuy's proposal, in a nutshell, is that constitutional
intentionality corresponds to a kind of self-organization. This proposal, as we
will see in later chapters, is one of the key guiding intuitions of the en-
active approach and neurophenomenology.

Husserl's terms horizon and ground are metaphorical, at once you
and geological. A horizon is not a thing "out there” but rather a struc-
ture of appearance. It therefore implicates or points back to the per-
ceiver for whom appearances are so structured. In phenomenological
language, “horizon” taken noematically as a structure of appearance
necessarily implicates “horizon” taken noetically as a structure of con-
sciousness. One could say that a horizon is the precondition for the ap-
pearance of anything, except that “precondition" is too static. Stated
in a genetic register, a horizon is a dynamic structure of disclosure in
which both the object (noema) and consciousness (noesis) partake
(Steinbock 1995, p. 107). Anything that comes forth, manifests, or
emerges does so in an open clearing or expanse, delimited by a

herent and ordered global behaviors, which are described by collective
variables or order parameters, constrain or govern the behavior of the
individual components, entraining them so that they no longer have
the same behavioral alternatives open to them as they would if they
were not interdependently woven into the coherent and ordered
global pattern. At the same time, the behavior of the components gen-
erates and sustains the global order. This two-sided or double determi-
nation is known as circular causality (Haken 1983).
Emergence and circular causality are crucially important in the con
text of neurodynamics. Neuroscience indicates that cognition, emo-
tion, and action require the transient integration of numerous, widely
distributed, and constantly interacting brain regions and areas. An
outstanding question for neuroscience today is to determine the
mechanisms of this large-scale integration. From a dynamic-system
perspective, large-scale integration corresponds to the forma

## Single-subject design

In design of experiments, single-subject design or single-case research design is a research design most often used in applied fields of psychology, education, and human behavior in which the subject serves as his/her own control, rather than using another individual/group. Researchers use single-subject design because these designs are sensitive to individual organism differences vs group designs which are sensitive to averages of groups. Often there will be large numbers of subjects in a research study using single-subject design, however—because the subject serves as their own control, this is still a single-subject design.[1] These designs are used primarily to evaluate the effect of a variety of interventions in applied research 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-subject_design

----




An N of 1 trial is a clinical trial in which a single patient is the entire trial, a single case study. A trial in which random allocation can be used to determine the order in which an experimental and a control intervention are given to a patient is an N of 1 randomized controlled trial. The order of experimental and control interventions can also be fixed by the researcher.

This type of study has enabled practitioners to achieve experimental progress without the overwhelming work of designing a group comparison study. It can be very effective in confirming causality. This can be achieved in many ways. One of the most common procedures is the ABA withdrawal experimental design, where the patient problem is measured before a treatment is introduced (baseline) and then measured again during the treatment and finally when the treatment has terminated. If the problem vanished during the treatment it can be established that the treatment was effective. But the N=1 study can also be executed in an AB quasi experimental way; this means that causality cannot be definitively demonstrated. Another variation is non-concurrent experimental design where different points in time are compared with one another. This experimental design also has a problem with causality, whereby statistical significance under a frequentist paradigm may be un-interpretable but other methods, such as clinical significance[1] or Bayesian methods should be considered. Many consider this framework to be a proof of concept or hypothesis generating process to inform subsequent, larger clinical trials. 

Design 	Causality 	Use
A-B 	Quasi experiment 	Often the only possible method
A-A1-A 	Experiment 	Placebo design where A is no drug and A1 is a placebo
A-B-A 	Experiment 	Withdrawal design where effects of B phase can be established
A-B-A-B 	Experiment 	Withdrawal design where effects of B phase can be established
A-B-A-B-A-B 	Experiment 	Withdrawal design where effects of B phase can be established
A-B1-B2-B3-Bn-A 	Experiment 	Establishing the effect of different versions of B phase

oi autopoiesis. In other words, the local mo-
lecular effects happen as they do because of the global and organiza-
tional context in which they are embedded. And it is this global level
that defines the bacterium as a biological individual and sucrose as
food.
Living structures are thus ontologically emergent with respect to mere
physical structures. They constitute a new order of nature that is qualita-
tively distinct from the merely physical order. This new order is marked
by two generic characteristics. The first is that an organism is an indi-
vidual in a new and precise sense that goes beyond the earlier notion of
physical individuality. Although Merleau-Ponty earlier stated that "the
physical form is an individual" (1963, p. 137), he now states that an or-
ganism "is an individual in a sense which is not that of even modern
physics" (p. 154). A physical form is an individual in the sense of being
an invariant topological pattern in a changing material substrate (like a
convection roll or soap bubble). Individuality in this case corresponds to
identity of form through material change. A living form, in the autopoi-
etic sense, is one whose own organization (defining network of rela-
tions) is the fundamental, morphodynamic invariant through material
change. An autopoietic system is a circular network whose constituent
molecular processes both produce and embody that network. Individu-
ality in this case corresponds to a formal self-identity—to an invariant dy-
namic pattern that is produced, maintained, and realized by the system
itself, while the system undergoes incessant material transformation and
regulates its external boundary conditions accordingly. An autopoietic
system is thus an individual in a sense that begins to be worthy of the
term self. The second generic characteristic marking the living order is
that the relation between organism and environment is meaningful and
normative. As Figure 3.3 depicts, meaning (or significance or informa-
tion) is implicated once there is the coupling of a co-defined self-pole
and environment-pole, and such coupling is intrinsically normative (in
the biological sense of norms discussed above).

The Structure of Behavior
another human subject (1963, p. 166). Human perception is primarily
directed toward how intentions are expressed in other human beings
rather than toward objects of nature and their sensory qualities.
Human perception grasps intentions as "experienced realities," not as
biects in a detached or intellectual sense. As Merleau-Ponty points
ut, anticipating subsequent research in developmental psychology.
the infant's first experienced realities in visual perception are the face
and gestures of the mother or caregiver. The mother's face is not an
obiect or a mere collection of sensory qualities, but a center of inten-
tional expression and action (see, for example, Meltzoff and Moore
1998; Stern 2000; Trevarthen and Aitken 2001). Perception is thus first
and foremost physiognomic, and later it is directed toward things as
use-objects. Perception never loses its physiognomic quality; it remains
physiognomic not simply in its nascent phases, but in its mature phe-
nomenal character (an idea that gains importance in Merleau-Ponty's
subsequent writings)
By "work," Merleau-Ponty means activities (ensembles of intentional
actions) that transform physical and living nature and thereby modify
the milieu or produce a new one (1963, p. 162). Work is forward-
looking and creative or productive. By altering the present milieu,
work in effect negates it in favor of a new one. (Merleau-Ponty uses the
word "work” instead of "action" precisely to convey this Hegelian
idea.) The correlative form of perception required for work is percep-
tion that presents its object not as something simply there now (some-
thing present and actual), but as something of use that can change
other things (something oriented in relation to the future and possi-
bilities).
Whereas living structures are ontologically emergent with respect to
physical ones, the human structure "perceived situation-work" is emer-
gent with respect to living structures. It represents a new kind of di-
cal relation between organism and milieu, or self and world. For
eason, Merleau-Ponty states: "although all actions permit an
aptation to life, the word 'life' does not have the same meaning in
mality and humanity; and the conditions of life are defined by the

milieu is social and cult

The Enactive Approach
cultural structures to which we are committed. Yet we refuse to let our-
selves become identical to them; we are always trying to pass beyond
them and create new things. In Merleau-Ponty's words: "use-objects
and cultural objects would not be what they are if the activity which
brings about their appearance did not also have as its meaning to re-
ject them and to surpass them" (1963, p. 176; emphasis omitted). This
self-surpassing mentality is a structural precondition for cultural forms
in the first place (even while it is always already reciprocally consti-
tuted by them in any of its concrete instances). Exemplified in the
human order, this mentality is emergent not simply in relation to the
living order overall, but also in relation to higher animals (1963, PP-
175-176).
a generative phenomenology
With these ideas, Merleau-Ponty passes from a static and gency
phenomenology of form or structure to a generative phenon
of intersubjectivity and culture (or from a phenomenal topology of 1
ture to a phenomenal topology of culture.)
In this book, I follow Merleau-Ponty's lead, beginning with life
velopment, and evolution (Chapters 5-7), then proceeding on
sciousness (Chapters 8-12), and finally discussing empathy and en
