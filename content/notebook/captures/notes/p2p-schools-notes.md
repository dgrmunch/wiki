**Attention!** **This is just a draft.**
 The final project will be eventually published in the SciArt Lab website. Feel free to contact **xmunch (at) xmunch.com** if you want to be part of the conversation. This is a work in progress and we are pretty much open to suggestions. 

## Scope

This project goes beyond the scope of STEAM education, one of the points in which the **SciArt Lab** has been usually focused. It is rather intended to define a common infrastructure for a heterogenous ecosystem of learning processes out of traditional school systems.

The idea of the *P2P Schools Framework* begun as a quest for possible answers to our personal problem as parents, which led us to look for a solution extendable to other people in the same situation.

By drafting a framework for a bottom-up learning system within the context of *unschoolers* and *worldschoolers*, we are embracing the ambitious attempt of modeling a network of families and collectives, an ecosystem of **P2P Schools** self-organized by the community of learners. This network can have different kinds of nodes:

  * **Family-managed P2P School:** a family or group of families in which both parent/s and kid/s are part of the maintenance of their own P2P School, sharing time, practices, materials, locations, knowledge, resources, and activities.
  
  * **Collective-managed P2P School:** an institution or collective (museum,  hacker space, charity, neighborhood association, activism collective, library...) can manage its own P2P School, providing experiences or resources to other participants in their communities and the network, co-creating a pool of value.

## Objective  

The project could explore possible solutions to address main problems of unschooling.

### The financial problem 

The so-called alternative models of education, usually not funded by governmental entities, are excluded from public educational systems and budgets.

The attractive of those *children-centric* and *respectful* approaches, in comparison to the traditional pedagogy of public schools, curricula-oriented, have led to the arrival of an elitist free market of *alternative schools*.

Branded as *Pikler*, *Montessori*, *Waldorf*, etc... those schools constitute a problem of inequality. Their location in areas of high social and economic status and their high fees, only easily affordable for economic elites or the upper-middle class, constitute a bottleneck and a class filter.

Some middle-class families assume a financial effort in terms of capital-labor in order to offer to their kids the possibility of a more respectful and fulfilling education. Some other families, specially those with more than one kid, do not consider that possibility. 

In some cases it is usually cheaper if one of the adults stops working in order to supervise, guide or accompany the kids. In the case of a single-parent household, this does not seem even plausible.

In that regard, opting-out of the public system for an unschooling lifestyle necessarily implies a financial problem in most of the cases, unless the household has rolling assets or passive income.

Actually, the fact of one parent leaving the job market is not always compatible with current life expenses. In cities with high rent, or in households which are paying a mortgage, renouncing to half of the family income implies a high financial risk. 

In that regard, incorporating an economic model for P2P Schools, in order to guarantee the stability of family income without compromising the co-creation of commons should be one of the main issues to discuss.

Depending on the age of the unschooled kids, their autonomy and  need for guidance/supervision can vary, and therefore, the *productive time* available for the parent can also increase. 

This financial side is probably one of the most complex aspects, and we hope the discussion could bring multiple ideas to consider. 

### Lack of interoperability

There are hundreds of initiatives to connect **unschooling families** all over the web, local and regional groups, playgroups, conferences and communities.

Interesting initiatives like the *Peer Unschooling Network* [[1]](https://peerunschooling.net), designed for teens, have allowed the emergence of unschooler communities. Nonprofit organizations like the **Alliance for Self-Directed Education (ASDE)** have been years "dedicated to normalizing and legitimizing Self-Directed Education, to make it available to everyone who seeks it" [[2]](https://www.self-directed.org/).

However, there is not a clear framework to bring interoperability to all those initiatives and articulate a commons-based peer-production approach.

One aspect to investigate is if we can bring value to these communities with a framework to operate locally while participating in a global ecosystem; a platform to make visible all those families and communities which are exploring new ways of learning, serving as a channel for interoperability between different methods, practices and approaches, as a mutual benefit for families. 

#### The framework

* Logos / Badges / Media / Community identity 
  * Families which don't fit in the current system will find a shared identity by becoming P2P Schools. 
* Web Platform:
  * The project should provide the web infrastructure to register a P2P School in the network.
  * P2P Schools will have access to an onboarding process to be included in the network. The onboarding process will include introductory videos and materials to the concept, the values of the project and the common goal of contributing to a new model of education.
  * This platform should allow members to find other P2P Schools in their area and any world location. 
  * P2P Schools will have access to resources, coordination and communication mechanisms with other schools.
* Research outcomes:  
  * P2P Schools will be able to include reports and participate in the polls and research projects.
  * Our research outcomes will provide value to the community,and will server as a feedback to improve.

## Target

Our initial target are families and communities that have access to traditional schools but are considering something beyond a curricula-oriented schooling and homeschooling model:

* Families who are directly embracing **unschooling** as a way to allow their kids to learn in freedom and explore learning in a self-directed way, guided by their interests and not a pre-design curricula.

* Families who are traveling to different countries during years or months as expats, digital nomads, researchers or activists, and find in **worldschooling** an alternative approach for their kids education.

* Families who are forced to *school* their kids but want to offer them an opportunity to learn after-class in a different way through participatory workshops, DIY commons production, etc... but don't have access to maker spaces / hacker spaces / fablabs. 

* Communities which, due to geographical circumstances or social problems, don't have access to a school system (ie. refugee camps) but that can be connected to the network through a **Collective-managed P2P School**.

In both cases the **P2P Schools** framework should provide value to families' needs, both in the case of:

* **Unschoolers**: during the time span in which this practice is not illegal (ages vary depending on the country).

* **Schoolers**: as a complementary tool for self-directed after-class experiences when unschooling is not a possibility.


## Future improvements

* The framework could be eventually forked and extended to operate with off-grid nodes, in order to be fully functional in communities without internet connection.

* Coordination and exchanges mechanism could be accomplished though a *P2P School Ambassadors* program, enabling interactions between communities in an off-the-grid way.
