## Greensboro - Nov 15th 2019

 > **Thought:** Yesterday we came back to North Carolina after two years living in Spain. Greensboro, the city which was twice our home, is welcoming us back for the third time. Walking around. Breathing under a rainbow of autumn leaves. Friends and relatives. Smells. Sounds. Hugs. Everything seems like it was when we left. Continuity. Sense of permanence. I literally feel that time did not pass by. Our life is still here. A life which ended with tears in our eyes. A life which disappeared when we took that plane with a set of promises and a suitcase full of memories. A goodbye which lead to a cultural reverse shock and several months of re-adaptation to the Spanish culture. Rhizome. Lack of temporality. Loop. Here we are. Breathing. Alive.


## America through photography I

 > **Thought:** From 2016 to 2018 my photographic style was influenced by the cinematic atmosphere of Gregory Crewdson’s work and the colors of William Magnum’s paintings. My portraits of the American society, from coast to coast, were characterized by highly edited and oversaturated shots. A comic-like visual exploration which combined sociological and ethnographic studies with extremely pushed-to-the-boundary digital editing. Capturing raw reality was less important that capturing my interpretation of that reality, an interpretation full of fascination, color and light. In that sense, my artwork was a mixture of street photography with Lightroom-intense experimentation. Using photography as a tool for drawing with pixels the diversity and complexity of American society. 


## America Through Photography II

 > **Thought:** In 2019 I came back to the U.S. with more nostalgia and familiarity than in my previous stays. The fascination of the newbie, and the over-saturation of my previous digital experiments, was replaced by pure black and white film photography. This time, rather than shooting with my Canon DSLR, I used a 1976 Pentax k1000 to capture my thoughts in film, as a reflection about the lack of temporality in conjunction with the materiality of inhabited spaces. Old film to capture the permanence of Greensboro, our home long time ago.


## Improving note-taking flow

In order to improve my note-taking flow, and automatically append thoughts, tasks, ideas, quotes or resources to the *Notebook* section of my **Commonplace book / personal wiki**, I decided to implement an easy-to-manage system based on already existing software. I have been doing some testing of my Automation Flow through *iOS Shortcuts* + *Dropbox sync* + a Unix Cron + my pCloud public folder and it works pretty well.

Possible Worlds
WHY DO CHILDREN PRETEND?
uman beings don't live in the real world. The real world is
what actually happened in the past, is happening now,
and will happen in the future. But we don't just live in
this single world. Instead, we live in a universe of many possible
worlds, all the ways the world could be in the future and also all
the ways the world could have been in the past, or might be in the
present. These possible worlds are what we call dreams and plans,
fictions and hypotheses. They are the products of hope and imag-
ination. Philosophers, more drily, call them "counterfactuals."
Counterfactuals are the woulda-coulda-shouldas of life, all the
things that might happen in the future, but haven't yet, or that
could have happened in the past, but didn't quite. Human beings
care deeply about those possible worlds-as deeply as they care
about the real actual world. On the surface counterfactual think-
ing seems like a very sophisticated and philosophically puzzling
ability. How can we think about things that aren't there? And why
should we think this way instead of restricting ourselves to the
actual world? It seems obvious that understanding the real world

Phenomenologists call this relation the correlational structure of in.
tentionality, "Correlational” does not mean the constant conjunction
of two terms that could be imagined to exist apart; rather, it refers to
the invariant structure of intentional act/intentional object. Object
directed intentional experiences necessarily comprise these two insep-
arable poles. In Husserlian phenomenological language, these two

poles are known as the “noema” (the object in its givenness) and the
noesis” (the mental act that intends and discloses the object in a cer-
tain manner).
We need to keep this framework in mind when we think about the
relation between the phenomenological conception of intentionality
and what philosophers of mind today call mental representation. In a
broad and theoretically neutral sense, a mental representation is sup-
posed to be a mental structure (concept, thought, image) with se-
mantic properties (content, truth conditions, reference), or a state or
process involving such a structure. Usually, a mental representation is
not considered to be an object of cognition or awareness, but rather
that by which one cognizes or is aware of something in the world.
Many phenomenologists would agree that intentional experience is
representational in this broad sense of having descriptive content-
that in intentional experience the world is represented in some partic-
ular way or other. Nevertheless, the phenomenological conception of
intentional experience has certain other distinctive features. First, in
phenomenology, as mentioned earlier, intentional experiences are
conceptualized not as states having content but as acts having directedness.
These two conceptions are not necessarily incompatible, but their the-
retiral orientation and emphasis are different. Second, "re-presenta-
nnnlies only to certain

Phenomenologists thus draw a crucial distinction between inten-
tional acts of presentation (Gegenwärtigung) and of re presentation (Verge-
genwärtigung) (see Marbach 1993). On the one hand, perceptual ex-
perience is presentational: in this type of experience the object is
given as present in its very being. In memory or imagination, on the
other hand, the object imagined or remembered is not given as
present in its very being, but rather as both phenomenally absent and
as mentally evoked or called forth. In this way, memory and imagina-
tion are said to be re-presentational. Note that the definitive feature
of re-presentational experience is that the object is given as absent
and as mentally evoked, but not necessarily as re-evoked or called
forth again. Re-evoking belongs to memory but not necessarily to vi-
sualizing or fantasizing. Note also that re-presentational experiences
do not float freely, as it were, but arise in relation to ongoing presen-

Mind emerges from matter and life at an empirical level, but at a transcendental level every form or structure is necessarily also a form of structure disclosed by consciousness. With this reversal one passes from the natural attitude of the scientist to the trascendental phenomenological attitude

 the first thing we need is some raw EEG data to process. This data is usually not clean so some preprocessing steps are needed. These often include the application of filters, such as a high-pass filter to remove the DC components of the signals and also the drifts (usually a frequency cut-off of 1 Hz is enough). A low pass filter can also be applied to remove the high frequency components. In EEG we currently rarely study frequencies above 90 Hz which correspond to the Gamma range. There are many other preprocessing techniques such as Electrooculogram (EOG) artefact correction, which might be necessary to apply if the subject under recording is keeping his/her eyes open. The reason is that blinks and eye movements generate strong electrical fields that affect our EEG recordings. Once our signals are clean, i.e. preprocessed, it is quite common to cut them in epochs of a few seconds and then extract features out of each one of these. This allows us to have a large number of features from a single EEG recording, which is always good when performing statistics or when applying classifiers

The next step could be considered the most important one: feature extraction. EEG signals are complex, making  it very hard to extract information out of them using only the naked eye. Nowadays, thanks to computers, we can apply complex automatic processing algorithms that allow us to extract ‘hidden’ information from EEG signals. There are several techniques such as time domain features (mean, standard deviation, entropy, …), frequency domain features (Fourier transform, wavelets, …)

The key question in a study on event-related potential is the averaging: we cut the EEG signal after each stimuli presentation, and we average all these epochs. That way we cancel out the intrinsic EEG noise and the important information survives, increasing the signal to noise ratio. We end up having a waveform with several peaks (i.e. potentials) that have a neurophysiological origin: our neurones synchronise and fire together in response to these external stimuli (event-related).

A very important characteristic of most event-related potential recordings is that the stimuli presentation needs to be very accurately synchronised with the EEG recording device, usually by means of a cable that sends a trigger to the EEG recording device each time a stimuli is presented. If the triggers are properly recorded along with the EEG signal, it is easy to automatically cut the signal in epochs for further averaging.

Steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)
Probably the simplest event-related potential. The subject is staring at a screen that is flickering at, let’s say, 20 Hz. The EEG recorded in the occipital electrodes, where visual information is processed, will present a 20 Hz oscillation and also oscillations at multiples of 20 Hz, called harmonics. In SSVEP, you don’t need any synchronisation between the stimuli presentation and the EEG recording device, since there is no averaging to be done. This technique has been widely used in brain-computer interfaces, since it’s easy to detect the different flickering frequencies the subject might be looking at in real time , thus allowing the user to control the movement of the mouse pointer on the screen, for instance.

Mismatch negativity (MMN)
this technique is usually studied for visual or auditory stimuli, and is based on the odd ball paradigm. A sequence of standard stimuli are presented to the subject (a sound for instance). From time to time, a deviant sound (different pitch, loudness and/or duration) is presented. The brain reaction to this deviant sound is a negative wave of about 200 ms (the so-called MMN wave) and a positive one of about 300 ms (also known as P300, see below) after the stimuli presentation (see image below for further clarification). One interesting fact about the MMN is that the subject under study does not need to be paying attention to the stimuli. The MMN will appear even if the subject is reading or watching a silent movie with subtitles. In other words, the MMN is an unconscious reaction of our brain to external stimuli. It seems that evolution has made our brain to be aware of strange noises. For sure this has been an important survival advantage for us, when our ancestors were in the middle of the jungle and suddenly a strange sound (i.e. a lion roar) made them run far or climb a tree.

The P300 is also associated with surprise, and it has been widely used in brain-computer interface applications. For instance a grid of flashing letters are presented to the user. The user fixes his/her attention on a specific letter he/she wants to spell. Each time the letter flashes, a P300 is recorded, and thus the computer can recognise which letter the user was spotting. This technique has allowed lock-in patients to communicate with the world, and it is considered the fastest brain-computer interface application in terms of bit rate

P300
The principle of the P300 is similar to the MMN, since it is also based on the oddball paradigm. Actually, P300 means positive wave of about 300 ms after the deviant stimuli is presented. The P300 is also associated with surprise, and it has been widely used in brain-computer interface applications. For instance a grid of flashing letters are presented to the user. The user fixes his/her attention on a specific letter he/she wants to spell. Each time the letter flashes, a P300 is recorded, and thus the computer can recognise which letter the user was spotting.

An accurate home sleep study to assess electroencephalography (EEG)-based sleep stages and EEG power would be advantageous for both clinical and research purposes, such as for longitudinal studies measuring changes in sleep stages over time. The purpose of this study was to compare sleep scoring of a single-channel EEG recorded simultaneously on the forehead against attended polysomnography. Participants were recruited from both a clinical sleep center and a longitudinal research study investigating cognitively-normal aging and Alzheimer's disease. Analysis for overall epoch-by-epoch agreement found strong and substantial agreement between the single-channel EEG compared to polysomnography (kappa=0.67). Slow wave activity in the frontal regions was also similar when comparing the single-channel EEG device to polysomnography. As expected, stage N1 showed poor agreement (sensitivity 0.2) due to lack of occipital electrodes. Other sleep parameters such as sleep latency and REM onset latency had decreased agreement. Participants with disrupted sleep consolidation, such as from obstructive sleep apnea, also had poor agreement. We suspect that disagreement in sleep parameters between the single-channel EEG and polysomnography is partially due to altered waveform morphology and/or poorer signal quality in the single-channel derivation. Our results show that single-channel EEG provides comparable results to polysomnography in assessing REM, combined stages N2 and N3 sleep, and several other parameters including frontal slow wave activity. The data establish that single-channel EEG can be a useful research tool.

Rapid eye movement sleep with rapid (saccadic) eye movements. While muscle "atonia" cannot be proven without a dedicated electromyogram (EMG) channel, certainly EMG artifact is absent with a "quiet" recording. Also, no alpha rhythm is present that would suggest wakefulness.
