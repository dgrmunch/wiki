## Introduction

As it has been written in the definition of the [visual koan](../concepts/visual_koan.md):

> Visual arts can be considered a valid cognitive gate to stop logical reasoning and activate in our brains a different kind of experience. An experience that enables judgments-free thought and an open-ended subjective exploration. 

> We can asume photography as the *einklammerung* (*bracketing* or "judgment suspension") mentioned by Husserl, a trigger to stop our natural state and switch to a different mode of perception and understanding of the world around us: the phenomenological *epoché*.

> [...] my photos are open doors to my own personal reflection, but they can be used as dark windows to look through in order to explore your own narratives.

The photography projects listed below summarize part of my artistic work of the last years. If you have any question regarding my photography, you can start a conversation from the [about me](../../about.md) section. To see some of my pictures on *Instagram* you can also check my [public portfolio](https://www.instagram.com/xmunch/).

Probably, in order to understand better my work, a quick look into the [pathways](../concepts/pathways.md) concept can be useful. Other [concepts](../concepts.md) can serve as inspirational entry points too. So feel free to go through the [rhizome](../concepts/rhizome.md) by opening new tabs in your browser while navigating the photography projects listed below.

I have also several notes about photography, as well as posts in my [microblog](../../tags/microblog.md). You can find them [by tag](../../tags/photography.md).

## Miscellanea: previous work

This album is a mixture of ‘shots’, an artistic projection about the diversity I have found through my personal trip, traveling, discovering different cultures and just living.

Photography is to me a way to explore the precious gift of life itself. Again, both phases of the process (the phase of capturing a picture and the phase of post-processing) are sort of a phenomenological experience.

Beauty is everywhere, in every single instant, waiting to be captured by us, waiting to be experienced by a social agent in a physical and social environment. And the way in which we observe reality is directly related with who we are. It is also a process of self-exploration.
