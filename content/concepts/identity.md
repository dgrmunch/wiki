## Description

There is not any biological reason to assume the existence of one's self in the cartesian sense. At the end, personal identity is just a conceptualization, a convenient linear explanation for a non-lineal reality. 

The notion of the self would rather be better understood as an emergent property of an embodied and dynamic system coupled to an environment. In other words, an emergent property of a self-organized (and autopoietic) agent endowed by a complex nervous system and sensorimotor capabilities. The self is a narrative, a subjective perception, produced by parallel processes taking place in a human brain, embodied in a human body and attached to a physical environment. 

In that regard, there is not need to reinforce the cartesian mind-body problem, inherited from platonic dualism. The perpetuation of the western attachment to the idea of the human soul, although secularized under the metaphor of a homunculus-like self (an independent "me" in a theoretical control center of our mind), is basically grounded in an imaginary artifact rather than in any evidence.

Nevertheless, the non-dualistic and [embodied dynamicist](#!tags/embodied dynamicism.md) approach to [cognitive science](#!tags/cognitive science.md) seems more plausible. There is obviously an [ontological individuation of cognitive agents](#!tags/individuation.md), as much as there is in the case of other self-organized systems. We all actually physically exist as autonomous entities within a context of circular causation, coupled to an environment but with our biological boundaries. The notion of a unified and detached self-contained "me" seems naive from a Complexity Science perspective; and yet, we all seem unable to explain any concept without relying on an internal narrator to self-identify with. The usefulness of personal identity constitutes obviously a fact and, imagined or not, a self-reinforced personal narrative provides meaning and purpose to our daily activities far beyond mere survival skills.  

Phenomenological investigations about personal identity and self-identification can provide remarkable insights. The philosophical rhizome provided in these pages is an attempt to dig into the complexities of the human mind in that regard.


## Looking for Identity

As any other content included in this site, the concept of *identity* does not follow the standardized or generally accepted definition. This wiki provides a map to navigate a subjective ontology (produced by an "individuated" cognitive agent, and therefore based in subjective experiences and reflections) rather than a *knowledge base* built on [consensus](consensus.md).

As said, personal identity and the notion of self can be understood as emergent properties of a complex biological system, interdependently embedded in an external ecosystem through dynamic interactions. Self-perception could be just a sophisticated process that enhances our adaptability and decision-making capabilities, producing as many "personalities" and personal narratives as contexts we need to adapt to, linking all together in a chronologically structured personal narrative of episodic memories and conscious experience. It could also be just an evolutionary artifact, a biologically random accident.

Additionally, from a performative perspective, we could tell that subjects are something different that what they perform in each specific social environment. Actually, we perform multiple roles and behave differently depending on the given context. Most of our interactions with the environment are a consequence of nurture rather than nature and most of the time we are "identified" as static "personas" from a behaviorist viewpoint rather than analyzing our complexity as dynamic complex systems, as biological and cognitive agents.

In that regard, identity does not seem an easy concept to describe. Actually, if we assume the existence of multiple cognitive processes with parallel and ephemeral existences, coexisting with each other without the need of permanent dominance but rather just flowing withing our synaptic rhizomes, things can be seen from a different angle.  

My current position on personal identity is based on the advances in cognitive science and the philosophical influence of scholars like Thomas Fuchs, Francis Heylighen, Francisco Varela or Evan Thompson. However, my quest for the understanding of identity started far beyond these ideas. I have actually addressed this quest through different [pathways](pathways.md) (you can read about them in the  [about me](../../about.md) section). 

For years, I  studied identity formation by following traditional methodologies and formal research. Everything began with synthetic biology and artificial life, with mathematical and computational simulations of social behavior. A quantitative and math-based approach to social research became my main asset. Nonetheless, after finishing grad school I moved towards ethnography, with a methodology with a radically more qualitative flavor, based on social anthropology and focused on ethnic and linguistic clusters. I even published a film titled [Looking for Identity](https://youtu.be/1rUHNIJ7rn0) exploring identity-related issues from an ethnographic perspective.

Notwithstanding my interest in keeping my subjective experience out of the game, my approach inevitably evolved towards pure [phenomenology](phenomenology.md), introspective self-inquiry and single-subject experiments. Eventually it lead me to the deconstruction of those lower-case identities, what I refer to like "the characters". I started to understand *identity* as something else, closer to John Locke's foundations about the self. And then, I killed Locke and discovered Hume. 

David Hume's approach and his *Bundle Theory of the Self* basically opened the gate for the deconstruction of Decartes *res cogito* and the negation of the existence of a self. Empiricism, Philosophy of Mind, Cognitive Science, Complexity Science, Neurophenomenology... I found interesting clues all over the place; in the works of Daniel Dennett, Thomas Fuchs, Evan Thompson or Thomas Metzinger, but also in the contributions of Jean Paul Sartre, Edmund Husserl, Nishida Kitaro and the praxis and theoretical investigations some zen schools.

In order to understand the complexity of identity one should deconstruct the dualistic cartesian conception. An attempt can be found in the article [Situated Epoché: towards a phenomenology of identity](../articles/situated.md).

## Interesting quotes

 > Thomas Metzinger (born 12 March 1958) is a German philosopher and professor of theoretical philosophy at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz. [...] In 2003 Metzinger published the monograph Being No One. In this book he argues that no such things as selves exist in the world: nobody ever had or was a self. All that exists are phenomenal selves, as they appear in conscious experience. He argues that the phenomenal self, however, is not a thing but an ongoing process; it is the content of a "transparent self-model." In 2009 Metzinger published a follow-up book to Being No One for a general audience: The Ego Tunnel (Basic Books, New York, ISBN 0-465-04567-7).

> "Daniel Dennett has a deflationary theory of the "self". Selves are not physically detectable. Instead, they are a kind of convenient fiction, like a center of gravity, which is convenient as a way of solving physics problems, although they need not correspond to anything tangible — the center of gravity of a hoop is a point in thin air. People constantly tell themselves stories to make sense of their world, and they feature in the stories as a character, and that convenient but fictional character is the self" [See source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_self)

> According to Hume there is nothing that is constantly stable which we could identify as the self, only a flow of differing experiences. Our view that there is something substantive which binds all of these experiences together is for Hume merely imaginary. The self is a fiction that is attributed to the entire flow of experiences. "I may venture to affirm of the rest of mankind, that they are nothing but a bundle or collection of different perceptions, which succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and movement."

> Locke admits that our impressions are constantly changing, but maintains that our consciousness or awareness remains unchanged. Though our sense impressions are perpetually in flux, the person perceiving the sense impressions remains the same. But remember Hume’s cardinal rule: no idea without a corresponding impression.

> When examined closely, our experience actually consists in a series of “still shot” impressions of the world. If we experienced the world as a series of random, stilted impressions, then we would have no notion of identity or personal identity.

> In other words, the psychological continuity that Locke sees as being the seat of personal identity is not a product of our impressions, but of how they are strung together. What fills in the gaps between our impressions, thus creating the illusion of continuous conscious experiences, are the relations that the imagination imposes on our impressions to make them intelligible.

> Yogachara (Sanskrit: योगाचार; IAST: Yogācāra; literally "yoga practice"; "one whose practice is yoga") is an influential tradition of Buddhist philosophy and psychology emphasizing the study of cognition, perception, and consciousness through the interior lens of meditative and yogic practices. It is also variously termed Vijñānavāda (विज्ञानवाद, the doctrine of consciousness), Vijñaptivāda (the doctrine of ideas or percepts) or Vijñaptimātratā-vāda (the doctrine of 'mere vijñapti), which is also the name given to its major epistemic theory. There are several interpretations of this main theory, some scholars see it as a kind of Idealism while others argue that it is closer to a kind of phenomenology or representationalism [...] The deepest, most pernicious erroneous view held by sentient beings is the view that a permanent, eternal, immutable, independent self exists. There is no such self, and deep down we know that. This makes us anxious, since it entails that no self or identity endures forever. In order to assuage that anxiety, we attempt to construct a self, to fill the anxious void, to do something enduring. The projection of cognitive objects for appropriation is consciousness's main tool for this construction. If I own things (ideas, theories, identities, material objects), then "I am." If there are eternal objects that I can possess, then I too must be eternal. To undermine this desperate and erroneous appropriative grasping, Yogācāra texts say: Negate the object, and the self is also negated (e.g., Madhyānta-vibhāga, 1:4, 8)."

> Yogācāra posits that cognitive objects are real, it denies "arthas" (objects of intentionality or "a telos toward which an act of consciousness intends") which are "outside the cognitive act in which it is that which is intended." So according to Lusthaus, "Yogacarins don't claim that nothing whatsoever exists outside the mind" and "Consciousness enjoys no transcendent status, nor does it serve as a metaphysical foundation. Consciousness is real by virtue of its facticity -- the fact that sentient beings experience cognitions -- and not because of an ontological primacy." In this way, instead of offering an ontological theory, Yogācāra focuses on understanding and eliminating the underlying tendencies (anuśaya) that lead to clinging to ontological constructions, which are just cognitive projections (pratibimba, parikalpita)" [See source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogachara#Representation-only)

## Notes


Negating the existence of the soul seems quite easy for somebody with a materialist/naturalist view of reality. If the universe is material, despite the fact of assuming the existence of subjective ontologies causally correlated with biological entities, there is no need to religious thought and supranatural entities such as gods, souls or angels.

However, the self and other aggregates of our subjective ontology (which only exist as mental entities in our brain) constitute kind of a core foundation for our daily life, and their negation seems quite hard, at least from a practical point of view. 

Assuming that ones self is just an imagined entity, as Daniel Dennett claims with his "illusion of conciousness", and that at the end we are just biological bundles of physical properties and interconnected complex sub-systems such as neurons and other kinds of cells, does not seem crazy though.

However, our first-person characters, as part of our subjective ontology, would still like to be expressed and self-reinforced. A way for me to explore my subjective ontology and know more about those characters, there personal narratives and the way in which they unfold every day is a fascinating subject. But writing about it without a continuous theoretical contradiction does not seem easy.

Maybe we should even discard any explicit assignation of meaning through *internal dialogs* and [sense-making](sense-making.md) processes and just open our minds to a different kind of experience.  But even when diluting our notion of self during practises such as meditation, our mind still jumps to our previous mental ontologies.

Being coherent does not seem easy therefore. The use of "I" is already an oxymoron if this text should be coherent with a *negationist* view of the self and provide a valid philosophical argument.

In that sense, to dig into the concept of *identity*, this wiki combines a mixture of different communication/writing styles, notes and poems with contradictory notions and styles.
