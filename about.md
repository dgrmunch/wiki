## Summary

I consider myself a multidisciplinary researcher, a mind hacker, a visual ethnographer and a nomad.

I have been living for some years in Greensboro (North Carolina, USA), leading the **SciArt Lab** while working remotely as Software Engineer at *Docuten*, developing software such as cryptographic solutions with digital signatures. I currently hold the position of *Blockchain Expert* at **Docuten**.

I have a wide background as a researcher. I’ve been Research Fellow at the **P2P Lab**, a spin-off of **Tallin University of Technology** and the **P2P Foundation**. I have collaborated with research groups such as the **Global Brain Institute of the Free University of Brussels**, the **Critical Making Lab at the University of Toronto** and the **University of North Carolina at Greensboro** in diverse topics such as Artificial Intelligence, Complex Adaptive Systems, P2P dynamics, IT, Software Development, Philosophy of Information Science and the Social Implications of Technology. 

I have also worked and collaborated with different universities in Spain (*URJC, UC3M, UPM,...*) and I still continue with an open collaboration as a researcher with *Complexys: Group of Economics and Complexity* at **University of Valencia**.

I am the founder and coordinator of **Bitmind**, a commons-oriented startup to explore the potential of DAOs/OVNs and the evolution of social complexity in agent-based models and production communities. Bitmind had an international impact in the context of Applied Research & Open Source development around OVNs/DAOs. Since 2017 it will be a project of the P2P Foundation.

I am also co-founder of the **SciArt Lab**, a digital R&D laboratory for the open exploration of Science, Art and Technology. We consider that a multidisciplinary approach is crucial to hack seemingly unrelated topics such as artificial intelligence, generative art, complex adaptive systems or digital photography.

Additionally, I am a hobbyist photographer, a self-guided researcher/writer and a digital artist. I have other side projects and conduct some self-directed research initiatives.

For years I have been exploring the evolution of social complexity in agent-based models. I have also studied diverse topics such as the intersection of artificial agent-based models with constructed languages or the application of *genetic algorithms* to music composition.

I enjoy self-guided research, applying qualitative approaches such as visual ethnography to study diversity of identity/identities in real social agents, open source coding to bootstrap the potential of mankind, or a [phenomenology-based](content/concepts/phenomenology.md) approach to philosophy to dig into the nature of human experience. My current research interests are cognitive science, self-organization, philosophy of mind, phenomenology and complex systems. 

## Pathways

In this section you can find some maps which can be helpful to understand in detail both my resume, my personal evolution and my academic/professional profile.
Every map is followed by a link to a section in which I deeply describe the corresponding pathway.

For example, below the *Academic Map* there is a link to a textual description of my [Academic Path](content/notebook/maps/academic.md).

You can also read about the importance and meaning of social agent's [pathways](content/concepts/pathways.md) in the [concepts](content/concepts.md) section.

### Academic Path

<div id="academicMap" style="position:relative; width: 100%; margin-bottom:10px;border: 1px solid black;"></div>

Read about my [Academic Path](content/notebook/maps/academic.md), a page which explains what I have learned through several years of study and research, an explanation which is contextualized in both a spatial and a temporal location.


### Personal Path

<div id="personalMap" style="position:relative; width: 100%; margin-bottom:10px;border: 1px solid black;"></div>

This representation of my personal path is just a bi-dimensional visualization of several years of trips around the globe. Obviously, it only represents a bird-view projection of countries and states which I had the chance to explore. 

It does not go deep in specific coordinates. It ignores cities, national parks, small towns, trails, lakes or mountains. It does not track any experiences in the ocean. Neither events, nor people or weather conditions are mentioned. Temporal details are not captured anyway. 

However, it summarizes how traveling constituted a very important part of my individual exploration. How moving freely has been as basic to me as breathing<!---; and even how a period of [*self-isolation*](content/articles/self-isolation.md) had important implications for my self-reflection regarding [identity](content/concepts/identity.md)-->.

Some time ago I wrote a post about how traveling helped me to [embrace the postmodern condition](../blog/output/blog/2017/la-llamada.html) but the radical importance of traveling in my philosophical quest is better addressed in this article about the [situated epoché](content/articles/situated.md).
