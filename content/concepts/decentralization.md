## What is decentralization?

Decentralization basically refers to a progressive transition from operations which originally required the figure of an intermediary to an scenario in which they can be carried out directly between peers. 

Decentralization can be described as a political, social, cultural and technical pathway towards bottom-up self-organization and de-hierarchization. 

 [P2P](../../tags/p2p.md) (peer-to-peer) technologies empower individuals by removing the middle man from their interactions, replacing centralized control and blind faith by a democratization of coordination, information sharing tools and consensus mechanisms. In other words, a transition from centralized dependencies to networks of trust in which peers are empowered by reliable technology and open protocols.

 [P2P](../../tags/p2p.md) technologies could lead to new practices of self-sovereignty, not only for the *cyberspace* inhabitants, but also for *off-the-grid* communities in rural areas (see *SSB*), political activists and journalists, _hackers_ and free thinkers all over the world.

Decentralization technologies, communities and projects:

* empower individuals, offering self-sovereignty out of the context of national states, political institutions or hierarchical companies by promoting horizontal organizations based on smart contracts and append-only logs, encoded in distributed hash tables, Merkle trees or other data structures.

* promote diversity and functional heterogeneity, by enabling permeable communities to develop their [own narratives](subjective_ontology.md) without censorship while interoperating with others

* overcome governmental and corporate surveillance with encryption and bottom-up trust mechanisms.

* deprecate centralized financial institutions and central banks by providing cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance. 

* replace the need of a centralized third-party to validate an agreement with distributed public audits.


* aim to replace centralized SaaS providers (like Dropbox in terms of storage, or Twitter and Facebook regarding social media) with self-hosting and distributed [P2P](../../tags/p2p.md) open source solutions. 

* promote transparency with public ledgers for decentralized public consensus and transactions tracking.

In the case of [blockchain](blockchain.md) technologies, blind faith is replaced by a publicly audited ledger that provides certainty in a [distributed](../../tags/distributed.md) way. In the case of *IPFS* or *Hypercore (previously Dat)* cloud-based storage is replaced by distributed cryptography-powered file-sharing networks.

Decentralized alternatives can also be used to create a new foundation for the WWW, like in the case Beaker Browser or Cabal chat.
